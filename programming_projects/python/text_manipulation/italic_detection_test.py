text = """The Rue Du Coq d'Or, Paris, seven in the morning. A succession of furious, choking yells
from the street. Madame Monce, who kept the little hotel opposite mine, had come out
onto the pavement to address a lodger on the third floor. Her bare feet were stuck into
sabots and her grey hair was streaming down.
Madame Monce: 'Sacrée salope! How many times have I told you not to squash bugs on
the wallpaper? Do you think you've bought the hotel, eh? Why can't you throw them out
of the window like everyone else? Espèce de traînée!'
The woman on the third floor: 'Va donc, eh! vieille vache!'
Thereupon a whole variegated chorus of yells, as windows were flung open on every
side and half the street joined in the quarrel. They shut up abruptly ten minutes later,
when a squadron of cavalry rode past and people stopped shouting to look at them.
I sketch this scene, just to convey something of the spirit of the Rue du Coq d'Or. Not
that quarrels were the only thing that happened there—but still, we seldom got through
the morning without at least one outburst of this description. Quarrels, and the desolate
cries of street hawkers, and the shouts of children chasing orange-peel over the cobbles,
and at night loud singing and the sour reek of the refuse-carts, made up the atmosphere
of the street.
It was a very narrow street—a ravine of tall leprous houses, lurching towards one
another in queer attitudes, as though they had all been frozen in the act of collapse. All
the houses were hotels and packed to the tiles with lodgers, mostly Poles, Arabs and
Italians. At the foot of the hotels were tiny bistros, where you could be drunk for the
equivalent of a shilling. On Saturday nights about a third of the male population of the
quarter was drunk. There was fighting over women, and the Arab navvies who lived in
the cheapest hotels used to conduct mysterious feuds, and fight them out with chairs
and occasionally revolvers. At night the policemen would only come through the street
two together. It was a fairly rackety place. And yet amid the noise and dirt lived the
usual respectable French shopkeepers, bakers and laundresses and the like, keeping
themselves to themselves and quietly piling up small fortunes. It was quite a
representative Paris slum.
My hotel was called the Hôtel des Trois Moineaux. It was a dark, rickety warren of five
storeys, cut up by wooden partitions into forty rooms. The rooms were small and
inveterately dirty, for there was no maid, and Madame F., the patronne, had no time to
do any sweeping. The walls were as thin as matchwood, and to hide the cracks they had
been covered with layer after layer of pink paper, which had come loose and housed
innumerable bugs. Near the ceiling long lines of bugs marched all day like columns of
soldiers, and at night came down ravenously hungry, so that one had to get up every few
hours and kill them in hecatombs. Sometimes when the bugs got too bad one used to
burn sulphur and drive them into the next room; whereupon the lodger next door
would retort by having his room sulphured, and drive the bugs back. It was a dirty place,
but homelike, for Madame F. and her husband were good sorts. The rent of the rooms
varied between thirty and fifty francs a week.
1
The lodgers were a floating population, largely foreigners, who used to turn up without
luggage, stay a week and then disappear again. They were of every trade—cobblers,
bricklayers, stonemasons, navvies, students, prostitutes, rag-pickers. Some of them
were fantastically poor. In one of the attics there was a Bulgarian student who made
fancy shoes for the American market. From six to twelve he sat on his bed, making a
dozen pairs of shoes and earning thirty-five francs; the rest of the day he attended
lectures at the Sorbonne. He was studying for the Church, and books of theology lay
face-down on his leather-strewn floor. In another room lived a Russian woman and her
son, who called himself an artist. The mother worked sixteen hours a day, darning socks
at twenty-five centimes a sock, while the son, decently dressed, loafed in the
Montparnasse cafés. One room was let to two different lodgers, one a day worker and
the other a night worker. In another room a widower shared the same bed with his two
grown-up daughters, both consumptive.
There were eccentric characters in the hotel. The Paris slums are a gathering-place for
eccentric people—people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and
given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of
behaviour, just as money frees people from work. Some of the lodgers in our hotel lived
lives that were curious beyond words.
There were the Rougiers, for instance, an old ragged, dwarfish couple who plied an
extraordinary trade. They used to sell postcards on the Boulevard St Michel. The curious
thing was that the postcards were sold in sealed packets as pornographic ones, but were
actually photographs of châteaux on the Loire; the buyers did not discover this till too
late, and of course never complained. The Rougiers earned about a hundred francs a
week, and by strict economy managed to be always half starved and half drunk. The filth
of their room was such that one could smell it on the floor below. According to Madame
F., neither of the Rougiers had taken off their clothes for four years.
Or there was Henri, who worked in the sewers. He was a tall, melancholy man with
curly hair, rather romantic-looking in his long sewer-man's boots. Henri's peculiarity
was that he did not speak, except for the purposes of work, literally for days together.
Only a year before he had been a chauffeur in good employ and saving money. One day
he fell in love, and when the girl refused him he lost his temper and kicked her. On being
kicked the girl fell desperately in love with Henri, and for a fortnight they lived together
and spent a thousand francs of Henri's money. Then the girl was unfaithful; Henri
planted a knife in her upper arm and was sent to prison for six months. As soon as she
had been stabbed the girl fell more in love with Henri than ever, and the two made up
their quarrel and agreed that when Henri came out of jail he should buy a taxi and they
would marry and settle down. But a fortnight later the girl was unfaithful again, and
when Henri came out she was with child. Henri did not stab her again. He drew out all
his savings and went on a drinking-bout that ended in another month's imprisonment;
after that he went to work in the sewers. Nothing would induce Henri to talk. If you
asked him why he worked in the sewers he never answered, but simply crossed his
wrists to signify handcuffs, and jerked his head southward, towards the prison. Bad luck
seemed to have turned him half-witted in a single day.
Or there was R., an Englishman, who lived six months of the year in Putney with his
parents and six months in France. During his time in France he drank four litres of wine
a day, and six litres on Saturdays; he had once travelled as far as the Azores, because the
wine there is cheaper than anywhere in Europe. He was a gentle, domesticated creature,
2
never rowdy or quarrelsome, and never sober. He would lie in bed till midday, and from
then till midnight he was in his corner of the bistro, quietly and methodically soaking.
While he soaked he talked, in a refined, womanish voice, about antique furniture. Except
myself, R. was the only Englishman in the quarter.
There were plenty of other people who lived lives just as eccentric as these: Monsieur
Jules, the Roumanian, who had a glass eye and would not admit it, Fureux the Limousin
stonemason, Roucolle the miser—he died before my time, though—old Laurent the ragmerchant, who used to copy his signature from a slip of paper he carried in his pocket. It
would be fun to write some of their biographies, if one had time. I am trying to describe
the people in our quarter, not for the mere curiosity, but because they are all part of the
story. Poverty is what I am writing about, and I had my first contact with poverty in this
slum. The slum, with its dirt and its queer lives, was first an object-lesson in poverty,
and then the background of my own experiences. It is for that reason that I try to give
some idea of what life was like there.

Chapter 2
Life in the quarter. Our bistro, for instance, at the foot of the Hôtel des Trois Moineaux. A
tiny brick-floored room, half underground, with wine-sodden tables, and a photograph
of a funeral inscribed 'Crédit est mort'; and red-sashed workmen carving sausage with
big jack-knives; and Madame F., a splendid Auvergnat peasant woman with the face of a
strong-minded cow, drinking Malaga all day 'for her stomach'; and games of dice
for apéritifs; and songs about 'Les Fraises et Les Framboises', and about Madelon, who
said, 'Comment épouser un soldat, moi qui aime tout le régiment?'; and extraordinarily
public love-making. Half the hotel used to meet in the bistro in the evenings. I wish one
could find a pub in London a quarter as cheery.
One heard queer conversations in the bistro. As a sample I give you Charlie, one of the
local curiosities, talking.
Charlie was a youth of family and education who had run away from home and lived on
occasional remittances. Picture him very pink and young, with the fresh cheeks and soft
brown hair of a nice little boy, and lips excessively red and wet, like cherries. His feet
are tiny, his arms abnormally short, his hands dimpled like a baby's. He has a way of
dancing and capering while he talks, as though he were too happy and too full of life to
keep still for an instant. It is three in the afternoon, and there is no one in
the bistro except Madame F. and one or two men who are out of work; but it is all the
same to Charlie whom he talks to, so long as he can talk about himself. He declaims like
an orator on a barricade, rolling the words on his tongue and gesticulating with his
short arms. His small, rather piggy eyes glitter with enthusiasm. He is, somehow,
profoundly disgusting to see.
He is talking of love, his favourite subject.
'Ah, l'amour, l'amour! Ah, que les femmes m'ont tué! Alas, messieurs et dames, women
have been my ruin, beyond all hope my ruin. At twenty-two I am utterly worn out and
finished. But what things I have learned, what abysses of wisdom have I not plumbed!
How great a thing it is to have acquired the true wisdom, to have become in the highest
sense of the word a civilized man, to have become raffiné, vicieux,' etc. etc.
'Messieurs et dames, I perceive that you are sad. Ah, mais la vie est belle—you must not
be sad. Be more gay, I beseech you!
Fill high ze bowl vid Samian vine,
Ve vill not sink of semes like zese!
'Ah, que la vie est belle! Listen, messieurs et dames, out of the fullness of my experience I
will discourse to you of love. I will explain to you what is the true meaning of love—
what is the true sensibility, the higher, more refined pleasure which is known to
civilized men alone. I will tell you of the happiest day of my life. Alas, but I am past the
time when I could know such happiness as that. It is gone for ever—the very possibility,
even the desire for it, are gone.

'Listen, then. It was two years ago; my brother was in Paris—he is a lawyer—and my
parents had told him to find me and take me out to dinner. We hate each other, my
brother and I, but he preferred not to disobey my parents. We dined, and at dinner he
grew very drunk upon three bottles of Bordeaux. I took him back to his hotel, and on the
way I bought a bottle of brandy, and when we had arrived I made my brother drink a
tumblerful of it—I told him it was something to make him sober. He drank it, and
immediately he fell down like somebody in a fit, dead drunk. I lifted him up and propped
his back against the bed; then I went through his pockets. I found eleven hundred
francs, and with that I hurried down the stairs, jumped into a taxi, and escaped. My
brother did not know my address—I was safe.
'Where does a man go when he has money? To the bordels, naturally. But you do not
suppose that I was going to waste my time on some vulgar debauchery fit only for
navvies? Confound it, one is a civilized man! I was fastidious, exigeant, you understand,
with a thousand francs in my pocket. It was midnight before I found what I was looking
for. I had fallen in with a very smart youth of eighteen, dressed en smoking and with his
hair cut à l'américaine, and we were talking in a quiet bistro away from the boulevards.
We understood one another well, that youth and I. We talked of this and that, and
discussed ways of diverting oneself. Presently we took a taxi together and were driven
away.
'The taxi stopped in a narrow, solitary street with a single gas-lamp flaring at the end.
There were dark puddles among the stones. Down one side ran the high blank wall of a
convent. My guide led me to a tall, ruinous house with shuttered windows, and knocked
several times at the door. Presently there was a sound of footsteps and a shooting of
bolts, and the door opened a little. A hand came round the edge of it; it was a large,
crooked hand, that held itself palm upwards under our noses, demanding money.
'My guide put his foot between the door and the step. "How much do you want?" he said.
'"A thousand francs," said a woman's voice. "Pay up at once or you don't come in."
'I put a thousand francs into the hand and gave the remaining hundred to my guide; he
said good night and left me. I could hear the voice inside counting the notes, and then a
thin old crow of a woman in a black dress put her nose out and regarded me
suspiciously before letting me in. It was very dark inside; I could see nothing except a
flaring gas-jet that illuminated a patch of plaster wall, throwing everything else into
deeper shadow. There was a smell of rats and dust. Without speaking, the old woman
lighted a candle at the gas-jet, then hobbled in front of me down a stone passage to the
top of a flight of stone steps.
'"Voilà!" she said; "go down into the cellar there and do what you like. I shall see
nothing, hear nothing, know nothing. You are free, you understand—perfectly free."
'Ah, messieurs, need I describe to you—forcément, you know it yourselves—that shiver,
half of terror and half of joy, that goes through one at these moments? I crept down,
feeling my way; I could hear my breathing and the scraping of my feet on the stones,
otherwise all was silence. At the bottom of the stairs my hand met an electric switch. I
turned it, and a great electrolier of twelve red globes flooded the cellar with a red light.
And behold, I was not in a cellar, but in a bedroom, a great rich garish bedroom,
coloured blood red from top to bottom. Figure it to yourselves, messieurs et dames! Red
carpet on the floor, red paper on the walls, red plush on the chairs, even the ceiling red;
everywhere red, burning into the eyes. It was a heavy, stifling red, as though the light
5
were shining through bowls of blood. At the far end stood a huge square bed, with quilts
red like the rest, and on it a girl was lying, dressed in a frock of red velvet. At the sight of
me she shrank away and tried to hide her knees under the short dress.
'I had halted by the door. "Come here, my chicken," I called to her.
'She gave a whimper of fright. With a bound I was beside the bed; she tried to elude me,
but I seized her by the throat—like this, do you see?—tight! She struggled, she began to
cry out for mercy, but I held her fast, forcing back her head and staring down into her
face. She was twenty years old, perhaps; her face was the broad dull face of a stupid
child, but it was coated with paint and powder, and her blue, stupid eyes, shining in the
red light, wore that shocked, distorted look that one sees nowhere save in the eyes of
these women. She was some peasant girl, doubtless, whom her parents had sold into
slavery.
'Without another word I pulled her off the bed and threw her onto the floor. And then I
fell upon her like a tiger! Ah, the joy, the incomparable rapture of that time!
There, messieurs et dames, here is what I would expound to you; voilà l'amour! There is
the true love, there is the only thing in the world worth striving for; there is the thing
beside which all your arts and ideals, all your philosophies and creeds, all your fine
words and high attitudes, are as pale and profitless as ashes. When one has experienced
love—the true love—what is there in the world that seems more than a mere ghost of
joy?
'More and more savagely I renewed the attack. Again and again the girl tried to escape;
she cried out for mercy anew, but I laughed at her.
'"Mercy!" I said, "do you suppose I have come here to show mercy? Do you suppose I
have paid a thousand francs for that?" I swear to you, messieurs et dames, that if it were
not for that accursed law that robs us of our liberty, I would have murdered her at that
moment.
'Ah, how she screamed, with what bitter cries of agony. But there was no one to hear
them; down there under the streets of Paris we were as secure as at the heart of a
pyramid. Tears streamed down the girl's face, washing away the powder in long dirty
smears. Ah, that irrecoverable time! You, messieurs et dames, you who have not
cultivated the finer sensibilities of love, for you such pleasure is almost beyond
conception. And I too, now that my youth is gone—ah, youth!—shall never again see life
so beautiful as that. It is finished.
'Ah yes, it is gone—gone for ever. Ah, the poverty, the shortness, the disappointment of
human joy! For in reality—car en réalité, what is the duration of the supreme moment of
love? It is nothing, an instant, a second perhaps. A second of ecstasy, and after that—
dust, ashes, nothingness.
'And so, just for one instant, I captured the supreme happiness, the highest and most
refined emotion to which human beings can attain. And in the same moment it was
finished, and I was left—to what? All my savagery, my passion, were scattered like the
petals of a rose. I was left cold and languid, full of vain regrets; in my revulsion I even
felt a kind of pity for the weeping girl on the floor. Is it not nauseous, that we should be
the prey of such mean emotions? I did not look at the girl again; my sole thought was to
get away. I hastened up the steps of the vault and out into the street. It was dark and
bitterly cold, the streets were empty, the stones echoed under my heels with a hollow,
6
lonely ring. All my money was gone, I had not even the price of a taxi fare. I walked back
alone to my cold, solitary room.
'But there, messieurs et dames, that is what I promised to expound to you. That is Love.
That was the happiest day of my life.'
He was a curious specimen, Charlie. I describe him, just to show what diverse characters
could be found flourishing in the Coq d'Or quarter.
7
Chapter 3
I lived in the Coq d'Or quarter for about a year and a half. One day, in summer, I found
that I had just four hundred and fifty francs left, and beyond this nothing but thirty-six
francs a week, which I earned by giving English lessons. Hitherto I had not thought
about the future, but I now realized that I must do something at once. I decided to start
looking for a job, and—very luckily as it turned out—I took the precaution of paying
two hundred francs for a month's rent in advance. With the other two hundred and fifty
francs, besides the English lessons, I could live a month, and in a month I should
probably find work. I aimed at becoming a guide to one of the tourist companies, or
perhaps an interpreter. However, a piece of bad luck prevented this.
One day there turned up at the hotel a young Italian who called himself a compositor. He
was rather an ambiguous person, for he wore side whiskers, which are the mark either
of an apache or an intellectual, and nobody was quite certain in which class to put him.
Madame F. did not like the look of him, and made him pay a week's rent in advance. The
Italian paid the rent and stayed six nights at the hotel. During this time he managed to
prepare some duplicate keys, and on the last night he robbed a dozen rooms, including
mine. Luckily he did not find the money that was in my pockets, so I was not left
penniless. I was left with just forty-seven francs—that is, seven and tenpence.
This put an end to my plans of looking for work. I had now got to live at the rate of about
six francs a day, and from the start it was too difficult to leave much thought for
anything else. It was now that my experiences of poverty began—for six francs a day, if
not actual poverty, is on the fringe of it. Six francs is a shilling, and you can live on a
shilling a day in Paris if you know how. But it is a complicated business.
It is altogether curious, your first contact with poverty. You have thought so much about
poverty—it is the thing you have feared all your life, the thing you knew would happen
to you sooner or later; and it is all so utterly and prosaically different. You thought it
would be quite simple; it is extraordinarily complicated. You thought it would be
terrible; it is merely squalid and boring. It is the peculiar lowness of poverty that you
discover first; the shifts that it puts you to, the complicated meanness, the crust-wiping.
You discover, for instance, the secrecy attaching to poverty. At a sudden stroke you have
been reduced to an income of six francs a day. But of course you dare not admit it—you
have got to pretend that you are living quite as usual. From the start it tangles you in a
net of lies, and even with the lies you can hardly manage it. You stop sending clothes to
the laundry, and the laundress catches you in the street and asks you why; you mumble
something, and she, thinking you are sending the clothes elsewhere, is your enemy for
life. The tobacconist keeps asking why you have cut down your smoking. There are
letters you want to answer, and cannot, because stamps are too expensive. And then
there are your meals—meals are the worst difficulty of all. Every day at mealtimes you
go out, ostensibly to a restaurant, and loaf an hour in the Luxembourg Gardens,
watching the pigeons. Afterwards you smuggle your food home in your pockets. Your
food is bread and margarine, or bread and wine, and even the nature of the food is
governed by lies. You have to buy rye bread instead of household bread, because the rye
8
loaves, though dearer, are round and can be smuggled in your pockets. This wastes you
a franc a day. Sometimes, to keep up appearances, you have to spend sixty centimes on a
drink, and go correspondingly short of food. Your linen gets filthy, and you run out of
soap and razor-blades. Your hair wants cutting, and you try to cut it yourself, with such
fearful results that you have to go to the barber after all, and spend the equivalent of a
day's food. All day you are telling lies, and expensive lies.
You discover the extreme precariousness of your six francs a day. Mean disasters
happen and rob you of food. You have spent your last eighty centimes on half a litre of
milk, and are boiling it over the spirit lamp. While it boils a bug runs down your
forearm; you give the bug a flick with your nail, and it falls plop! straight into the milk.
There is nothing for it but to throw the milk away and go foodless.
You go to the baker's to buy a pound of bread, and you wait while the girl cuts a pound
for another customer. She is clumsy, and cuts more than a pound. 'Pardon, monsieur,'
she says, 'I suppose you don't mind paying two sous extra?' Bread is a franc a pound,
and you have exactly a franc. When you think that you too might be asked to pay two
sous extra, and would have to confess that you could not, you bolt in panic. It is hours
before you dare venture into a baker's shop again.
You go to the greengrocer's to spend a franc on a kilogram of potatoes. But one of the
pieces that make up the franc is a Belgian piece, and the shopman refuses it. You slink
out of the shop, and can never go there again.
You have strayed into a respectable quarter, and you see a prosperous friend coming.
To avoid him you dodge into the nearest café. Once in the café you must buy something,
so you spend your last fifty centimes on a glass of black coffee with a dead fly in it. One
could multiply these disasters by the hundred. They are part of the process of being
hard up.
You discover what it is like to be hungry. With bread and margarine in your belly, you
go out and look into the shop windows. Everywhere there is food insulting you in huge,
wasteful piles; whole dead pigs, baskets of hot loaves, great yellow blocks of butter,
strings of sausages, mountains of potatoes, vast Gruyère cheeses like grindstones. A
snivelling self-pity comes over you at the sight of so much food. You plan to grab a loaf
and run, swallowing it before they catch you; and you refrain, from pure funk.
You discover the boredom which is inseparable from poverty; the times when you have
nothing to do and, being underfed, can interest yourself in nothing. For half a day at a
time you lie on your bed, feeling like the jeune squelette in Baudelaire's poem. Only food
could rouse you. You discover that a man who has gone even a week on bread and
margarine is not a man any longer, only a belly with a few accessory organs.
This—one could describe it further, but it is all in the same style—is life on six francs a
day. Thousands of people in Paris live it—struggling artists and students, prostitutes
when their luck is out, out-of-work people of all kinds. It is the suburbs, as it were, of
poverty.
I continued in this style for about three weeks. The forty-seven francs were soon gone,
and I had to do what I could on thirty-six francs a week from the English lessons. Being
inexperienced, I handled the money badly, and sometimes I was a day without food.
When this happened I used to sell a few of my clothes, smuggling them out of the hotel
in small packets and taking them to a second-hand shop in the Rue de la Montagne St
Geneviève. The shopman was a red-haired Jew, an extraordinarily disagreeable man,
9
who used to fall into furious rages at the sight of a client. From his manner one would
have supposed that we had done him some injury by coming to him. 'Merde!' he used to
shout, 'you here again? What do you think this is? A soup kitchen?' And he paid
incredibly low prices. For a hat which I had bought for twenty-five shillings and scarcely
worn he gave five francs, for a good pair of shoes five francs, for shirts a franc each. He
always preferred to exchange rather than buy, and he had a trick of thrusting some
useless article into one's hand and then pretending that one had accepted it. Once I saw
him take a good overcoat from an old woman, put two white billiard-balls into her hand,
and then push her rapidly out of the shop before she could protest. It would have been a
pleasure to flatten the Jew's nose, if only one could have afforded it.
These three weeks were squalid and uncomfortable, and evidently there was worse
coming, for my rent would be due before long. Nevertheless, things were not a quarter
as bad as I had expected. For, when you are approaching poverty, you make one
discovery which outweighs some of the others. You discover boredom and mean
complications and the beginnings of hunger, but you also discover the great redeeming
feature of poverty: the fact that it annihilates the future. Within certain limits, it is
actually true that the less money you have, the less you worry. When you have a
hundred francs in the world you are liable to the most craven panics. When you have
only three francs you are quite indifferent; for three francs will feed you till tomorrow,
and you cannot think further than that. You are bored, but you are not afraid. You think
vaguely, 'I shall be starving in a day or two—shocking, isn't it?' And then the mind
wanders to other topics. A bread and margarine diet does, to some extent, provide its
own anodyne.
And there is another feeling that is a great consolation in poverty. I believe everyone
who has been hard up has experienced it. It is a feeling of relief, almost of pleasure, at
knowing yourself at last genuinely down and out. You have talked so often of going to
the dogs—and well, here are the dogs, and you have reached them, and you can stand it.
It takes off a lot of anxiety.

Chapter 4
One day my English lessons ceased abruptly. The weather was getting hot and one of my
pupils, feeling too lazy to go on with his lessons, dismissed me. The other disappeared
from his lodgings without notice, owing me twelve francs. I was left with only thirty
centimes and no tobacco. For a day and a half I had nothing to eat or smoke, and then,
too hungry to put it off any longer, I packed my remaining clothes into my suitcase and
took them to the pawnshop. This put an end to all pretence of being in funds, for I could
not take my clothes out of the hotel without asking Madame F.'s leave. I remember,
however, how surprised she was at my asking her instead of removing the clothes on
the sly, shooting the moon being a common trick in our quarter.
It was the first time that I had been into a French pawnshop. One went through
grandiose stone portals (marked, of course, 'Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité'—they write that
even over the police stations in France) into a large bare room like a school classroom,
with a counter and rows of benches. Forty or fifty people were waiting. One handed
one's pledge over the counter and sat down. Presently, when the clerk had assessed its
value, he would call out, 'Numéro such and such, will you take fifty francs?' Sometimes it
was only fifteen francs, or ten, or five—whatever it was, the whole room knew it. As I
came in the clerk called with an air of offence, 'Numéro 83—here!' and gave a little
whistle and a beckon, as though calling a dog. Numéro 83 stepped to the counter; he was
an old bearded man, with an overcoat buttoned up at the neck and frayed trouser-ends.
Without a word the clerk shot the bundle across the counter—evidently it was worth
nothing. It fell to the ground and came open, displaying four pairs of men's woollen
pants. No one could help laughing. Poor Numéro 83 gathered up his pants and shambled
out, muttering to himself.
The clothes I was pawning, together with the suitcase, had cost over twenty pounds, and
were in good condition. I thought they must be worth ten pounds, and a quarter of this
(one expects quarter value at a pawnshop) was two hundred and fifty or three hundred
francs. I waited without anxiety, expecting two hundred francs at the worst.
At last the clerk called my number: 'Numéro 97!'
'Yes,' I said, standing up.
'Seventy francs?'
Seventy francs for ten pounds' worth of clothes! But it was no use arguing; I had seen
someone else attempt to argue, and the clerk had instantly refused the pledge. I took the
money and the pawnticket and walked out. I had now no clothes except what I stood up
in—the coat badly out at elbow—an overcoat, moderately pawnable, and one spare
shirt. Afterwards, when it was too late, I learned that it is wiser to go to a pawnshop in
the afternoon. The clerks are French, and, like most French people, are in a bad temper
till they have eaten their lunch.
When I got home, Madame F. was sweeping the bistro floor. She came up the steps to
meet me. I could see in her eye that she was uneasy about my rent.
'Well,' she said, 'what did you get for your clothes? Not much, eh?'
11
'Two hundred francs,' I said promptly.
'Tiens!' she said, surprised; 'well, that's not bad. How expensive those English clothes
must be!'
The lie saved a lot of trouble, and, strangely enough, it came true. A few days later I did
receive exactly two hundred francs due to me for a newspaper article, and, though it
hurt to do it, I at once paid every penny of it in rent. So, though I came near to starving
in the following weeks, I was hardly ever without a roof.
It was now absolutely necessary to find work, and I remembered a friend of mine, a
Russian waiter named Boris, who might be able to help me. I had first met him in the
public ward of a hospital, where he was being treated for arthritis in the left leg. He had
told me to come to him if I were ever in difficulties.
I must say something about Boris, for he was a curious character and my close friend for
a long time. He was a big, soldierly man of about thirty-five, and had been good-looking,
but since his illness he had grown immensely fat from lying in bed. Like most Russian
refugees, he had had an adventurous life. His parents, killed in the Revolution, had been
rich people, and he had served through the war in the Second Siberian Rifles, which,
according to him, was the best regiment in the Russian Army. After the war he had first
worked in a brush factory, then as a porter at Les Halles, then had become a dishwasher,
and had finally worked his way up to be a waiter. When he fell ill he was at the Hôtel
Scribe, and taking a hundred francs a day in tips. His ambition was to become a maître
d'hôtel, save fifty thousand francs, and set up a small, select restaurant on the Right
Bank.
Boris always talked of the war as the happiest time of his life. War and soldiering were
his passion; he had read innumerable books of strategy and military history, and could
tell you all about the theories of Napoleon, Kutuzof, Clausewitz, Moltke and Foch.
Anything to do with soldiers pleased him. His favourite café was the Closerie des Lilas in
Montparnasse, simply because the statue of Marshal Ney stands outside it. Later on,
Boris and I sometimes went to the Rue du Commerce together. If we went by Metro,
Boris always got out at Cambronne station instead of Commerce, though Commerce was
nearer; he liked the association with General Cambronne, who was called on to
surrender at Waterloo, and answered simply, 'Merde!'
The only things left to Boris by the Revolution were his medals and some photographs
of his old regiment; he had kept these when everything else went to the pawnshop.
Almost every day he would spread the photographs out on the bed and talk about them:
'Voilà, mon ami! There you see me at the head of my company. Fine big men, eh? Not like
these little rats of Frenchmen. A captain at twenty—not bad, eh? Yes, a captain in the
Second Siberian Rifles; and my father was a colonel.
'Ah, mais, mon ami, the ups and downs of life! A captain in the Russian Army, and then,
piff! the Revolution—every penny gone. In 1916 I stayed a week at the Hôtel Edouard
Sept; in 1920 I was trying for a job as night watchman there. I have been night
watchman, cellarman, floor scrubber, dishwasher, porter, lavatory attendant. I have
tipped waiters, and I have been tipped by waiters.
'Ah, but I have known what it is to live like a gentleman, mon ami. I do not say it to boast,
but the other day I was trying to compute how many mistresses I have had in my life,
12
and I made it out to be over two hundred. Yes, at least two hundred . . . Ah, well, ça
reviendra. Victory is to him who fights the longest. Courage!' etc. etc.
Boris had a queer, changeable nature. He always wished himself back in the army, but
he had also been a waiter long enough to acquire the waiter's outlook. Though he had
never saved more than a few thousand francs, he took it for granted that in the end he
would be able to set up his own restaurant and grow rich. All waiters, I afterwards
found, talk and think of this; it is what reconciles them to being waiters. Boris used to
talk interestingly about hotel life:
'Waiting is a gamble,' he used to say; 'you may die poor, you may make your fortune in a
year. You are not paid wages, you depend on tips—ten per cent of the bill, and a
commission from the wine companies on champagne corks. Sometimes the tips are
enormous. The barman at Maxim's, for instance, makes five hundred francs a day. More
than five hundred, in the season . . . I have made two hundred francs a day myself. It was
at a hotel in Biarritz, in the season. The whole staff, from the manager down to
the plongeurs, was working twenty-one hours a day. Twenty-one hours' work and two
and a half hours in bed, for a month on end. Still, it was worth it, at two hundred francs a
day.
'You never know when a stroke of luck is coming. Once when I was at the Hôtel Royal an
American customer sent for me before dinner and ordered twenty-four brandy
cocktails. I brought them all together on a tray, in twenty-four glasses. "Now, garçon,"
said the customer (he was drunk), "I'll drink twelve and you'll drink twelve, and if you
can walk to the door afterwards you get a hundred francs." I walked to the door, and he
gave me a hundred francs. And every night for six days he did the same thing; twelve
brandy cocktails, then a hundred francs. A few months later I heard he had been
extradited by the American Government—embezzlement. There is something fine, do
you not think, about these Americans?'
I liked Boris, and we had interesting times together, playing chess and talking about war
and hotels. Boris used often to suggest that I should become a waiter. 'The life would
suit you,' he used to say; 'when you are in work, with a hundred francs a day and a nice
mistress, it's not bad. You say you go in for writing. Writing is bosh. There is only one
way to make money at writing, and that is to marry a publisher's daughter. But you
would make a good waiter if you shaved that moustache off. You are tall and you speak
English—those are the chief things a waiter needs. Wait till I can bend this accursed
leg, mon ami. And then, if you are ever out of a job, come to me.'
Now that I was short of my rent, and getting hungry, I remembered Boris's promise, and
decided to look him up at once. I did not hope to become a waiter so easily as he had
promised, but of course I knew how to scrub dishes, and no doubt he could get me a job
in the kitchen. He had said that dishwashing jobs were to be had for the asking during
the summer. It was a great relief to remember that I had after all one influential friend
to fall back on.
13
Chapter 5
A short time before, Boris had given me an address in the Rue du Marché des Blancs
Manteaux. All he had said in his letter was that 'things were not marching too badly',
and I assumed that he was back at the Hôtel Scribe, touching his hundred francs a day. I
was full of hope, and wondered why I had been fool enough not to go to Boris before. I
saw myself in a cosy restaurant, with jolly cooks singing love-songs as they broke eggs
into the pan, and five solid meals a day. I even squandered two francs fifty on a packet of
Gauloises Bleu, in anticipation of my wages.
In the morning I walked down to the Rue du Marché des Blancs Manteaux; with a shock,
I found it a slummy back street as bad as my own. Boris's hotel was the dirtiest hotel in
the street. From its dark doorway there came out a vile sour odour, a mixture of slops
and synthetic soup—it was Bouillon Zip, twenty-five centimes a packet. A misgiving
came over me. People who drink Bouillon Zip are starving, or near it. Could Boris
possibly be earning a hundred francs a day? A surly patron, sitting in the office, said to
me, Yes, the Russian was at home—in the attic. I went up six flights of narrow, winding
stairs, the Bouillon Zip growing stronger as one got higher. Boris did not answer when I
knocked at his door, so I opened it and went in.
The room was an attic ten feet square, lighted only by a skylight, its sole furniture a
narrow iron bedstead, a chair, and a washhandstand with one game leg. A long S-shaped
chain of bugs marched slowly across the wall above the bed. Boris was lying asleep,
naked, his large belly making a mound under the grimy sheet. His chest was spotted
with insect bites. As I came in he woke up, rubbed his eyes, and groaned deeply.
'Name of Jesus Christ!' he exclaimed, 'oh, name of Jesus Christ, my back! Curse it, I
believe my back is broken!'
'What's the matter?' I exclaimed.
'My back is broken, that is all. I have spent the night on the floor. Oh, name of Jesus
Christ! If you knew what my back feels like!'
'My dear Boris, are you ill?'
'Not ill, only starving—yes, starving to death if this goes on much longer. Besides
sleeping on the floor, I have lived on two francs a day for weeks past. It is fearful. You
have come at a bad moment, mon ami.'
It did not seem much use to ask whether Boris still had his job at the Hôtel Scribe. I
hurried downstairs and bought a loaf of bread. Boris threw himself on the bread and ate
half of it, after which he felt better, sat up in bed, and told me what was the matter with
him. He had failed to get a job after leaving the hospital, because he was still very lame,
and he had spent all his money and pawned everything, and finally starved for several
days. He had slept a week on the quay under the Pont d'Austerlitz, among some empty
wine barrels. For the past fortnight he had been living in this room, together with a Jew,
a mechanic. It appeared (there was some complicated explanation) that the Jew owed
Boris three hundred francs, and was repaying this by letting him sleep on the floor and
allowing him two francs a day for food. Two francs would buy a bowl of coffee and three
14
rolls. The Jew went to work at seven in the mornings, and after that Boris would leave
his sleeping-place (it was beneath the skylight, which let in the rain) and get into the
bed. He could not sleep much even there, owing to the bugs, but it rested his back after
the floor.
It was a great disappointment, when I had come to Boris for help, to find him even
worse off than myself. I explained that I had only about sixty francs left and must get a
job immediately. By this time, however, Boris had eaten the rest of the bread and was
feeling cheerful and talkative. He said carelessly:
'Good heavens, what are you worrying about? Sixty francs—why, it's a fortune! Please
hand me that shoe, mon ami. I'm going to smash some of those bugs if they come within
reach.'
'But do you think there's any chance of getting a job?'
'Chance? It's a certainty. In fact, I have got something already. There is a new Russian
restaurant which is to open in a few days in the Rue du Commerce. It is une chose
entendue that I am to be maître d'hôtel. I can easily get you a job in the kitchen. Five
hundred francs a month and your food—tips, too, if you are lucky.'
'But in the meantime? I've got to pay my rent before long.'
'Oh, we shall find something. I have got a few cards up my sleeve. There are people who
owe me money, for instance—Paris is full of them. One of them is bound to pay up
before long. Then, think of all the women who have been my mistress! A woman never
forgets, you know—I have only to ask and they will help me. Besides, the Jew tells me he
is going to steal some magnetos from the garage where he works, and he will pay us five
francs a day to clean them before he sells them. That alone would keep us. Never
worry, mon ami. Nothing is easier to get than money.'
'Well, let's go out now and look for a job.'
'Presently, mon ami. We shan't starve, don't you fear. This is only the fortune of war—
I've been in a worse hole scores of times. It's only a question of persisting. Remember
Foch's maxim: "Attaquez! Attaquez! Attaquez!"'
It was midday before Boris decided to get up. All the clothes he now had left were one
suit, with one shirt, collar and tie, a pair of shoes almost worn out, and a pair of socks all
holes. He had also an overcoat which was to be pawned in the last extremity. He had a
suitcase, a wretched twenty-franc cardboard thing, but very important, because
the patron of the hotel believed that it was full of clothes—without that, he would
probably have turned Boris out of doors. What it actually contained were the medals
and photographs, various odds and ends, and huge bundles of love-letters. In spite of all
this Boris managed to keep a fairly smart appearance. He shaved without soap and with
a razor-blade two months old, tied his tie so that the holes did not show, and carefully
stuffed the soles of his shoes with newspaper. Finally, when he was dressed, he
produced an ink-bottle and inked the skin of his ankles where it showed through his
socks. You would never have thought, when it was finished, that he had recently been
sleeping under the Seine bridges.
We went to a small café off the Rue de Rivoli, a well-known rendezvous of hotel
managers and employees. At the back was a dark, cave-like room where all kinds of
hotel workers were sitting—smart young waiters, others not so smart and clearly
hungry, fat pink cooks, greasy dishwashers, battered old scrubbing-women. Everyone
15
had an untouched glass of black coffee in front of him. The place was, in effect, an
employment bureau, and the money spent on drinks was the patron's commission.
Sometimes a stout, important-looking man, obviously a restaurateur, would come in
and speak to the barman, and the barman would call to one of the people at the back of
the café. But he never called to Boris or me, and we left after two hours, as the etiquette
was that you could only stay two hours for one drink. We learned afterwards, when it
was too late, that the dodge was to bribe the barman; if you could afford twenty francs
he would generally get you a job.
We went to the Hôtel Scribe and waited an hour on the pavement, hoping that the
manager would come out, but he never did. Then we dragged ourselves down to the Rue
du Commerce, only to find that the new restaurant, which was being redecorated, was
shut up and the patron away. It was now night. We had walked fourteen kilometres over
pavement, and we were so tired that we had to waste one franc fifty on going home by
Metro. Walking was agony to Boris with his game leg, and his optimism wore thinner
and thinner as the day went on. When we got out of the Metro at the Place d'Italie he
was in despair. He began to say that it was no use looking for work—there was nothing
for it but to try crime.
'Sooner rob than starve, mon ami. I have often planned it. A fat, rich American—some
dark corner down Montparnasse way—a cobblestone in a stocking—bang! And then go
through his pockets and bolt. It is feasible, do you not think? I would not flinch—I have
been a soldier, remember.'
He decided against the plan in the end, because we were both foreigners and easily
recognized.
When we had got back to my room we spent another one franc fifty on bread and
chocolate. Boris devoured his share, and at once cheered up like magic; food seemed to
act on his system as rapidly as a cocktail. He took out a pencil and began making a list of
the people who would probably give us jobs. There were dozens of them, he said.
'Tomorrow we shall find something, mon ami, I know it in my bones. The luck always
changes. Besides, we both have brains—a man with brains can't starve.
'What things a man can do with brains! Brains will make money out of anything. I had a
friend once, a Pole, a real man of genius; and what do you think he used to do? He would
buy a gold ring and pawn it for fifteen francs. Then—you know how carelessly the
clerks fill up the tickets—where the clerk had written "en or" he would add "et
diamants" and he would change "fifteen francs" to "fifteen thousand". Neat, eh? Then,
you see, he could borrow a thousand francs on the security of the ticket. That is what I
mean by brains . . .'
For the rest of the evening Boris was in a hopeful mood, talking of the times we should
have together when we were waiters together at Nice or Biarritz, with smart rooms and
enough money to set up mistresses. He was too tired to walk the three kilometres back
to his hotel, and slept the night on the floor of my room, with his coat rolled round his
shoes for a pillow.
16
Chapter 6
We again failed to find work the next day, and it was three weeks before the luck
changed. My two hundred francs saved me from trouble about the rent, but everything
else went as badly as possible. Day after day Boris and I went up and down Paris,
drifting at two miles an hour through the crowds, bored and hungry, and finding
nothing. One day, I remember, we crossed the Seine eleven times. We loitered for hours
outside service doorways, and when the manager came out we would go up to him
ingratiatingly, cap in hand. We always got the same answer: they did not want a lame
man, nor a man without experience. Once we were very nearly engaged. While he spoke
to the manager Boris stood straight upright, not supporting himself with his stick, and
the manager did not see that he was lame. 'Yes,' he said, 'we want two men in the
cellars. Perhaps you would do. Come inside.' Then Boris moved, and the game was up.
'Ah,' said the manager, 'you limp. Malheureusement—'
We enrolled our names at agencies and answered advertisements, but walking
everywhere made us slow, and we seemed to miss every job by half an hour. Once we
very nearly got a job swabbing out railway trucks, but at the last moment they rejected
us in favour of Frenchmen. Once we answered an advertisement calling for hands at a
circus. You had to shift benches and clean up litter, and, during the performance, stand
on two tubs and let a lion jump through your legs. When we got to the place, an hour
before the time named, we found a queue of fifty men already waiting. There is some
attraction in lions, evidently.
Once an agency to which I had applied months earlier sent me a petit bleu, telling me of
an Italian gentleman who wanted English lessons. The petit bleu said 'Come at once' and
promised twenty francs an hour. Boris and I were in despair. Here was a splendid
chance, and I could not take it, for it was impossible to go to the agency with my coat out
at elbow. Then it occurred to us that I could wear Boris's coat—it did not match my
trousers, but the trousers were grey and might pass for flannel at a short distance. The
coat was so much too big for me that I had to wear it unbuttoned and keep one hand in
my pocket. I hurried out, and wasted seventy-five centimes on a bus fare to get to the
agency. When I got there I found that the Italian had changed his mind and left Paris.
Once Boris suggested that I should go to Les Halles and try for a job as a porter. I arrived
at half-past four in the morning, when the work was getting into its swing. Seeing a
short fat man in a bowler hat directing some porters, I went up to him and asked for
work. Before answering he seized my right hand and felt the palm.
'You are strong, eh?' he said.
'Very strong,' I said untruly.
'Bien. Let me see you lift that crate.'
It was a huge wicker basket full of potatoes. I took hold of it, and found that, so far from
lifting it, I could not even move it. The man in the bowler hat watched me, then shrugged
his shoulders and turned away. I made off. When I had gone some distance I looked back
17
and saw four men lifting the basket onto a cart. It weighed three hundredweight,
possibly. The man had seen that I was no use, and taken this way of getting rid of me.
Sometimes in his hopeful moments Boris spent fifty centimes on a stamp and wrote to
one of his ex-mistresses, asking for money. Only one of them ever replied. It was a
woman who, besides having been his mistress, owed him two hundred francs. When
Boris saw the letter waiting and recognized the handwriting, he was wild with hope. We
seized the letter and rushed up to Boris's room to read it, like a child with stolen sweets.
Boris read the letter, then handed it silently to me. It ran:
My Little Cherished Wolf,
With what delight did I open thy charming letter, reminding me of the days of our perfect
love, and of the so dear kisses which I have received from thy lips. Such memories linger for
ever in the heart, like the perfume of a flower that is dead.
As to thy request for two hundred francs, alas! it is impossible. Thou dost not know, my
dear one, how I am desolated to hear of thy embarrassments. But what wouldst thou? In
this life which is so sad, trouble comes to everyone. I too have had my share. My little sister
has been ill (ah, the poor little one, how she suffered!) and we are obliged to pay I know
not what to the doctor. All our money is gone and we are passing, I assure thee, very
difficult days.
Courage, my little wolf, always the courage! Remember that the bad days are not for ever,
and the trouble which seems so terrible will disappear at last.
Rest assured, my dear one, that I will remember thee always. And receive the most sincere
embraces of her who has never ceased to love thee, thy
Yvonne.
This letter disappointed Boris so much that he went straight to bed and would not look
for work again that day.
My sixty francs lasted about a fortnight. I had given up the pretence of going out to
restaurants, and we used to eat in my room, one of us sitting on the bed and the other
on the chair. Boris would contribute his two francs and I three or four francs, and we
would buy bread, potatoes, milk and cheese, and make soup over my spirit lamp. We
had a saucepan and a coffee-bowl and one spoon; every day there was a polite squabble
as to who should eat out of the saucepan and who out of the coffee-bowl (the saucepan
held more), and every day, to my secret anger, Boris gave in first and had the saucepan.
Sometimes we had more bread in the evening, sometimes not. Our linen was getting
filthy, and it was three weeks since I had had a bath; Boris, so he said, had not had a bath
for months. It was tobacco that made everything tolerable. We had plenty of tobacco, for
some time before Boris had met a soldier (the soldiers are given their tobacco free) and
bought twenty or thirty packets at fifty centimes each.
All this was far worse for Boris than for me. The walking and sleeping on the floor kept
his leg and back in constant pain, and with his vast Russian appetite he suffered
torments of hunger, though he never seemed to grow thinner. On the whole he was
surprisingly gay, and he had vast capacities for hope. He used to say seriously that he
had a patron saint who watched over him, and when things were very bad he would
search the gutter for money, saying that the saint often dropped a two-franc piece there.
One day we were waiting in the Rue Royale; there was a Russian restaurant near by, and
we were going to ask for a job there. Suddenly Boris made up his mind to go into the
18
Madeleine and burn a fifty-centime candle to his patron saint. Then, coming out, he said
that he would be on the safe side, and solemnly put a match to a fifty-centime stamp, as
a sacrifice to the immortal gods. Perhaps the gods and the saints did not get on together;
at any rate, we missed the job.
On some mornings Boris collapsed in the most utter despair. He would lie in bed almost
weeping, cursing the Jew with whom he lived. Of late the Jew had become restive about
paying the daily two francs, and, what was worse, had begun putting on intolerable airs
of patronage. Boris said that I, as an Englishman, could not conceive what torture it was
to a Russian of family to be at the mercy of a Jew.
'A Jew, mon ami, a veritable Jew! And he hasn't even the decency to be ashamed of it. To
think that I, a captain in the Russian Army—have I ever told you, mon ami, that I was a
captain in the Second Siberian Rifles? Yes, a captain, and my father was a colonel. And
here I am, eating the bread of a Jew. A Jew . . .
'I will tell you what Jews are like. Once, in the early months of the war, we were on the
march, and we had halted at a village for the night. A horrible old Jew, with a red beard
like Judas Iscariot, came sneaking up to my billet. I asked him what he wanted. "Your
honour," he said, "I have brought a girl for you, a beautiful young girl only seventeen. It
will only be fifty francs." "Thank you," I said, "you can take her away again. I don't want
to catch any diseases." "Diseases!" cried the Jew, "mais, monsieur le capitaine, there's no
fear of that. It's my own daughter!" That is the Jewish national character for you.
'Have I ever told you, mon ami, that in the old Russian Army it was considered bad form
to spit on a Jew? Yes, we thought a Russian officer's spittle was too precious to be
wasted on Jews . . .' etc. etc.
On these days Boris usually declared himself too ill to go out and look for work. He
would lie till evening in the greyish, verminous sheets, smoking and reading old
newspapers. Sometimes we played chess. We had no board, but we wrote down the
moves on a piece of paper, and afterwards we made a board from the side of a packingcase, and a set of men from buttons, Belgian coins and the like. Boris, like many
Russians, had a passion for chess. It was a saying of his that the rules of chess are the
same as the rules of love and war, and that if you can win at one you can win at the
others. But he also said that if you have a chessboard you do not mind being hungry,
which was certainly not true in my case.
19
Chapter 7
My money oozed away—to eight francs, to four francs, to one franc, to twenty-five
centimes; and twenty-five centimes is useless, for it will buy nothing except a
newspaper. We went several days on dry bread, and then I was two and a half days with
nothing to eat whatever. This was an ugly experience. There are people who do fasting
cures of three weeks or more, and they say that fasting is quite pleasant after the fourth
day; I do not know, never having gone beyond the third day. Probably it seems different
when one is doing it voluntarily and is not underfed at the start.
The first day, too inert to look for work, I borrowed a rod and went fishing in the Seine,
baiting with bluebottles. I hoped to catch enough for a meal, but of course I did not. The
Seine is full of dace, but they grew cunning during the siege of Paris, and none of them
has been caught since, except in nets. On the second day I thought of pawning my
overcoat, but it seemed too far to walk to the pawnshop, and I spent the day in bed,
reading the Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. It was all that I felt equal to, without food.
Hunger reduces one to an utterly spineless, brainless condition, more like the aftereffects of influenza than anything else. It is as though one had been turned into a
jellyfish, or as though all one's blood had been pumped out and lukewarm water
substituted. Complete inertia is my chief memory of hunger; that, and being obliged to
spit very frequently, and the spittle being curiously white and flocculent, like cuckoospit. I do not know the reason for this, but everyone who has gone hungry several days
has noticed it.
On the third morning I felt very much better. I realized that I must do something at once,
and I decided to go and ask Boris to let me share his two francs, at any rate for a day or
two. When I arrived I found Boris in bed, and furiously angry. As soon as I came in he
burst out, almost choking:
'He has taken it back, the dirty thief! He has taken it back!'
'Who's taken what?' I said.
'The Jew! Taken my two francs, the dog, the thief! He robbed me in my sleep!'
It appeared that on the previous night the Jew had flatly refused to pay the daily two
francs. They had argued and argued, and at last the Jew had consented to hand over the
money; he had done it, Boris said, in the most offensive manner, making a little speech
about how kind he was, and extorting abject gratitude. And then in the morning he had
stolen the money back before Boris was awake.
This was a blow. I was horribly disappointed, for I had allowed my belly to expect food,
a great mistake when one is hungry. However, rather to my surprise, Boris was far from
despairing. He sat up in bed, lighted his pipe and reviewed the situation.
'Now listen, mon ami, this is a tight corner. We have only twenty-five centimes between
us, and I don't suppose the Jew will ever pay my two francs again. In any case his
behaviour is becoming intolerable. Will you believe it, the other night he had the
indecency to bring a woman in here, while I was there on the floor. The low animal! And
I have a worse thing to tell you. The Jew intends clearing out of here. He owes a week's
20
rent, and his idea is to avoid paying that and give me the slip at the same time. If the Jew
shoots the moon I shall be left without a roof, and the patron will take my suitcase in
lieu of rent, curse him! We have got to make a vigorous move.'
'All right. But what can we do? It seems to me that the only thing is to pawn our
overcoats and get some food.'
'We'll do that, of course, but I must get my possessions out of this house first. To think of
my photographs being seized! Well, my plan is ready. I'm going to forestall the Jew and
shoot the moon myself. Foutre le camp—retreat, you understand. I think that is the
correct move, eh?'
'But my dear Boris, how can you, in daytime? You're bound to be caught.'
'Ah well, it will need strategy, of course. Our patron is on the watch for people slipping
out without paying their rent; he's been had that way before. He and his wife take it in
turns all day to sit in the office—what misers, these Frenchmen! But I have thought of a
way to do it, if you will help.'
I did not feel in a very helpful mood, but I asked Boris what his plan was. He explained it
carefully.
'Now listen. We must start by pawning our overcoats. First go back to your room and
fetch your overcoat, then come back here and fetch mine, and smuggle it out under
cover of yours. Take them to the pawnshop in the Rue des Francs Bourgeois. You ought
to get twenty francs for the two, with luck. Then go down to the Seine bank and fill your
pockets with stones, and bring them back and put them in my suitcase. You see the idea?
I shall wrap as many of my things as I can carry in a newspaper, and go down and ask
the patron the way to the nearest laundry. I shall be very brazen and casual, you
understand, and of course the patron will think the bundle is nothing but dirty linen. Or
if he does suspect anything, he will do what he always does, the mean sneak; he will go
up to my room and feel the weight of my suitcase. And when he feels the weight of
stones he will think it is still full. Strategy, eh? Then afterwards I can come back and
carry my other things out in my pockets.'
'But what about the suitcase?'
'Oh, that? We shall have to abandon it. The miserable thing only cost twenty francs.
Besides, one always abandons something in a retreat. Look at Napoleon at the Beresina!
He abandoned his whole army.'
Boris was so pleased with this scheme (he called it une ruse de guerre) that he almost
forgot being hungry. Its main weakness—that he would have nowhere to sleep after
shooting the moon—he ignored.
At first the ruse de guerre worked well. I went home and fetched my overcoat (that
made already nine kilometres, on an empty belly) and smuggled Boris's coat out
successfully. Then a hitch occurred. The receiver at the pawnshop, a nasty sour-faced
interfering little man—a typical French official—refused the coats on the ground that
they were not wrapped up in anything. He said that they must be put either in a valise
or a cardboard box. This spoiled everything, for we had no box of any kind, and with
only twenty-five centimes between us we could not buy one.
I went back and told Boris the bad news. 'Merde!' he said, 'that makes it awkward. Well,
no matter, there is always a way. We'll put the overcoats in my suitcase.'
21
'But how are we to get the suitcase past the patron? He's sitting almost in the door of the
office. It's impossible!'
'How easily you despair, mon ami! Where is that English obstinacy that I have read of?
Courage! We'll manage it.'
Boris thought for a little while, and then produced another cunning plan. The essential
difficulty was to hold the patron's attention for perhaps five seconds, while we could
slip past with the suitcase. But, as it happened, the patron had just one weak spot—that
he was interested in Le Sport, and was ready to talk if you approached him on this
subject. Boris read an article about bicycle races in an old copy of the Petit Parisien, and
then, when we had reconnoitred the stairs, went down and managed to set
the patron talking. Meanwhile I waited at the foot of the stairs, with the overcoats under
one arm and the suitcase under the other. Boris was to give a cough when he thought
the moment favourable. I waited trembling, for at any moment the patron's wife might
come out of the door opposite the office, and then the game was up. However, presently
Boris coughed. I sneaked rapidly past the office and out into the street, rejoicing that my
shoes did not creak. The plan might have failed if Boris had been thinner, for his big
shoulders blocked the doorway of the office. His nerve was splendid, too; he went on
laughing and talking in the most casual way, and so loud that he quite covered any noise
I made. When I was well away he came and joined me round the corner, and we bolted.
And then, after all our trouble, the receiver at the pawnshop again refused the
overcoats. He told me (one could see his French soul revelling in the pedantry of it) that
I had not sufficient papers of identification; my carte d'identité was not enough, and I
must show a passport or addressed envelopes. Boris had addressed envelopes by the
score, but his carte d'identité was out of order (he never renewed it, so as to avoid the
tax), so we could not pawn the overcoats in his name. All we could do was to trudge up
to my room, get the necessary papers, and take the coats to the pawnshop in the
Boulevard Port Royal.
I left Boris at my room and went down to the pawnshop. When I got there I found that it
was shut and would not open till four in the afternoon. It was now about half-past one,
and I had walked twelve kilometres and had had no food for sixty hours. Fate seemed to
be playing a series of extraordinarily unamusing jokes.
Then the luck changed as though by a miracle. I was walking home through the Rue
Broca, when suddenly, glittering on the cobbles, I saw a five-sou piece. I pounced on it,
hurried home, got our other five-sou piece, and bought a pound of potatoes. There was
only enough alcohol in the stove to parboil them, and we had no salt, but we wolfed
them skins and all. After that we felt like new men, and sat playing chess till the
pawnshop opened.
At four o'clock I went back to the pawnshop. I was not hopeful, for if I had only got
seventy francs before, what could I expect for two shabby overcoats in a cardboard
suitcase? Boris had said twenty francs, but I thought it would be ten francs, or even five.
Worse yet, I might be refused altogether, like poor Numéro 83 on the previous occasion.
I sat on the front bench, so as not to see people laughing when the clerk said five francs.
At last the clerk called my number: 'Numéro 117!'
'Yes,' I said, standing up.
'Fifty francs?'
22
It was almost as great a shock as the seventy francs had been the time before. I believe
now that the clerk had mixed my number up with someone else's, for one could not
have sold the coats outright for fifty francs. I hurried home and walked into my room
with my hands behind my back, saying nothing. Boris was playing with the chessboard.
He looked up eagerly.
'What did you get?' he exclaimed. 'What, not twenty francs? Surely you got ten francs,
anyway? Nom de Dieu, five francs—that is a bit too thick. Mon ami, don't say it was five
francs. If you say it was five francs I shall really begin to think of suicide.'
I threw the fifty-franc note onto the table. Boris turned white as chalk, and then,
springing up, seized my hand and gave it a grip that almost broke the bones. We ran out,
bought bread and wine, a piece of meat and alcohol for the stove, and gorged.
After eating, Boris became more optimistic than I had ever known him. 'What did I tell
you?' he said. 'The fortune of war! This morning with five sous, and now look at us. I
have always said it, there is nothing easier to get than money. And that reminds me, I
have a friend in the Rue Fondary whom we might go and see. He has cheated me of four
thousand francs, the thief. He is the greatest thief alive when he is sober, but it is a
curious thing, he is quite honest when he is drunk. I should think he would be drunk by
six in the evening. Let's go and find him. Very likely he will pay up a hundred on
account. Merde! He might pay two hundred. Allons-y!'
We went to the Rue Fondary and found the man, and he was drunk, but we did not get
our hundred francs. As soon as he and Boris met there was a terrible altercation on the
pavement. The other man declared that he did not owe Boris a penny, but that on the
contrary Boris owed him four thousand francs, and both of them kept appealing to me
for my opinion. I never understood the rights of the matter. The two argued and argued,
first in the street, then in a bistro, then in a prix fixe restaurant where we went for
dinner, then in another bistro. Finally, having called one another thieves for two hours,
they went off together on a drinking bout that finished up the last sou of Boris's money.
Boris slept the night at the house of a cobbler, another Russian refugee, in the
Commerce quarter. Meanwhile I had eight francs left, and plenty of cigarettes, and was
stuffed to the eyes with food and drink. It was a marvellous change for the better after
two bad days.
23
Chapter 8
We had now twenty-eight francs in hand, and could start looking for work once more.
Boris was still sleeping, on some mysterious terms, at the house of the cobbler, and he
had managed to borrow another twenty francs from a Russian friend. He had friends,
mostly ex-officers like himself, here and there all over Paris. Some were waiters or
dishwashers, some drove taxis, a few lived on women, some had managed to bring
money away from Russia and owned garages or dancing-halls. In general, the Russian
refugees in Paris are hard-working people, and have put up with their bad luck far
better than one can imagine Englishmen of the same class doing. There are exceptions,
of course. Boris told me of an exiled Russian duke whom he had once met, who
frequented expensive restaurants. The duke would find out if there was a Russian
officer among the waiters, and, after he had dined, call him in a friendly way to his table.
'Ah,' the duke would say, 'so you are an old soldier, like myself? These are bad days, eh?
Well, well, the Russian soldier fears nothing. And what was your regiment?'
'The so-and-so, sir,' the waiter would answer.
'A very gallant regiment! I inspected them in 1912. By the way, I have unfortunately left
my notecase at home. A Russian officer will, I know, oblige me with three hundred
francs.'
If the waiter had three hundred francs he would hand it over, and, of course, never see it
again. The duke made quite a lot in this way. Probably the waiters did not mind being
swindled. A duke is a duke, even in exile.
It was through one of these Russian refugees that Boris heard of something which
seemed to promise money. Two days after we had pawned the overcoats, Boris said to
me rather mysteriously:
'Tell me, mon ami, have you any political opinions?'
'No,' I said.
'Neither have I. Of course, one is always a patriot; but still—Did not Moses say
something about spoiling the Egyptians? As an Englishman you will have read the Bible.
What I mean is, would you object to earning money from Communists?'
'No, of course not.'
'Well, it appears that there is a Russian secret society in Paris who might do something
for us. They are Communists; in fact they are agents for the Bolsheviks. They act as a
friendly society, get in touch with exiled Russians, and try to get them to turn Bolshevik.
My friend has joined their society, and he thinks they would help us if we went to them.'
'But what can they do for us? In any case they won't help me, as I'm not a Russian.'
'That is just the point. It seems that they are correspondents for a Moscow paper, and
they want some articles on English politics. If we go to them at once they may
commission you to write the articles.'
'Me? But I don't know anything about politics.'
24
'Merde! Neither do they. Who does know anything about politics? It's easy. All you have
to do is to copy it out of the English papers. Isn't there a Paris Daily Mail? Copy it from
that.'
'But the Daily Mail is a Conservative paper. They loathe the Communists.'
'Well, say the opposite of what the Daily Mail says, then you can't be wrong. We mustn't
throw this chance away, mon ami. It might mean hundreds of francs.'
I did not at all like the idea, for the Paris police are very hard on Communists, especially
if they are foreigners, and I was already under suspicion. Some months before, a
detective had seen me come out of the office of a Communist weekly paper, and I had
had a great deal of trouble with the police. If they caught me going to this secret society,
it might mean deportation. However, the chance seemed too good to be missed. That
afternoon Boris's friend, another waiter, came to take us to the rendezvous. I cannot
remember the name of the street—it was a shabby street running south from the Seine
bank, somewhere near the Chamber of Deputies. Boris's friend insisted on great caution.
We loitered casually down the street, marked the doorway we were to enter—it was a
laundry—and then strolled back again, keeping an eye on all the windows and cafés. If
the place were known as a haunt of Communists it was probably watched, and we
intended to go home if we saw anyone at all like a detective. I was frightened, but Boris
enjoyed these conspiratorial proceedings, and quite forgot that he was about to trade
with the slayers of his parents.
When we were certain that the coast was clear we dived quickly into the doorway. In
the laundry was a Frenchwoman ironing clothes, who told us that 'the Russian
gentlemen' lived up a staircase across the courtyard. We went up several flights of dark
stairs and emerged onto a landing. A strong, surly-looking young man, with hair
growing low on his head, was standing at the top of the stairs. As I came up he looked at
me suspiciously, barred the way with his arm and said something in Russian.
'Mot d'ordre!' he said sharply when I did not answer.
I stopped, startled. I had not expected passwords.
'Mot d'ordre!' repeated the Russian.
Boris's friend, who was walking behind, now came forward and said something in
Russian, either the password or an explanation. At this the surly young man seemed
satisfied, and led us into a small shabby room with frosted windows. It was like a very
poverty-stricken office, with propaganda posters in Russian lettering and a huge, crude
picture of Lenin tacked on the walls. At the table sat an unshaven Russian in shirt
sleeves, addressing newspaper wrappers from a pile in front of him. As I came in he
spoke to me in French, with a bad accent.
'This is very careless!' he exclaimed fussily. 'Why have you come here without a parcel
of washing?'
'Washing?'
'Everybody who comes here brings washing. It looks as though they were going to the
laundry downstairs. Bring a good large bundle next time. We don't want the police on
our tracks.'
This was even more conspiratorial than I had expected. Boris sat down in the only
vacant chair, and there was a great deal of talking in Russian. Only the unshaven man
25
talked; the surly one leaned against the wall with his eyes on me, as though he still
suspected me. It was queer, standing in the little secret room with its revolutionary
posters, listening to a conversation of which I did not understand a word. The Russians
talked quickly and eagerly, with smiles and shrugs of the shoulders. I wondered what it
was all about. They would be calling each other 'little father', I thought, and 'little dove',
and 'Ivan Alexandrovitch', like the characters in Russian novels. And the talk would be
of revolutions. The unshaven man would be saying firmly, 'We never argue. Controversy
is a bourgeois pastime. Deeds are our arguments.' Then I gathered that it was not this
exactly. Twenty francs was being demanded, for an entrance fee apparently, and Boris
was promising to pay it (we had just seventeen francs in the world). Finally Boris
produced our precious store of money and paid five francs on account.
At this the surly man looked less suspicious, and sat down on the edge of the table. The
unshaven one began to question me in French, making notes on a slip of paper. Was I a
Communist? he asked. By sympathy, I answered; I had never joined any organization.
Did I understand the political situation in England? Oh, of course, of course. I mentioned
the names of various Ministers, and made some contemptuous remarks about the
Labour Party. And what about Le Sport? Could I do articles on Le Sport? (Football and
Socialism have some mysterious connection on the Continent.) Oh, of course, again.
Both men nodded gravely. The unshaven one said:
'Évidemment, you have a thorough knowledge of conditions in England. Could you
undertake to write a series of articles for a Moscow weekly paper? We will give you the
particulars.'
'Certainly.'
'Then, comrade, you will hear from us by the first post tomorrow. Or possibly the
second post. Our rate of pay is a hundred and fifty francs an article. Remember to bring
a parcel of washing next time you come. Au revoir, comrade.'
We went downstairs, looked carefully out of the laundry to see that there was no one in
the street, and slipped out. Boris was wild with joy. In a sort of sacrificial ecstasy he
rushed into the nearest tobacconist's and spent fifty centimes on a cigar. He came out
thumping his stick on the pavement and beaming.
'At last! At last! Now, mon ami, our fortune really is made. You took them in finely. Did
you hear him call you comrade? A hundred and fifty francs an article—Nom de Dieu,
what luck!'
Next morning when I heard the postman I rushed down to the bistro for my letter; to my
disappointment, it had not come. I stayed at home for the second post; still no letter.
When three days had gone by and I had not heard from the secret society, we gave up
hope, deciding that they must have found somebody else to do their articles.
Ten days later we made another visit to the office of the secret society, taking care to
bring a parcel that looked like washing. And the secret society had vanished! The
woman in the laundry knew nothing—she simply said that 'ces messieurs' had left some
days ago, after trouble about the rent. What fools we looked, standing there with our
parcel! But it was a consolation that we had paid only five francs instead of twenty.
And that was the last we ever heard of the secret society. Who or what they really were,
nobody knew. Personally I do not think they had anything to do with the Communist
Party; I think they were simply swindlers, who preyed upon Russian refugees by
26
extracting entrance fees to an imaginary society. It was quite safe, and no doubt they are
still doing it in some other city. They were clever fellows, and played their part
admirably. Their office looked exactly as a secret Communist office should look, and as
for that touch about bringing a parcel of washing, it was genius.
27
Chapter 9
For three more days we continued traipsing about looking for work, coming home for
diminishing meals of soup and bread in my bedroom. There were now two gleams of
hope. In the first place, Boris had heard of a possible job at the Hôtel X., near the Place
de la Concorde, and in the second, the patron of the new restaurant in the Rue du
Commerce had at last come back. We went down in the afternoon and saw him. On the
way Boris talked of the vast fortunes we should make if we got this job, and of the
importance of making a good impression on the patron.
'Appearance—appearance is everything, mon ami. Give me a new suit and I will borrow
a thousand francs by dinner-time. What a pity I did not buy a collar when we had
money. I turned my collar inside out this morning; but what is the use, one side is as
dirty as the other. Do you think I look hungry, mon ami?'
'You look pale.'
'Curse it, what can one do on bread and potatoes? It is fatal to look hungry. It makes
people want to kick you. Wait.'
He stopped at a jeweller's window and smacked his cheeks sharply to bring the blood
into them. Then, before the flush had faded, we hurried into the restaurant and
introduced ourselves to the patron.
The patron was a short, fattish, very dignified man with wavy grey hair, dressed in a
smart double-breasted flannel suit and smelling of scent. Boris told me that he was an
ex-colonel of the Russian Army. His wife was there too, a horrid fat Frenchwoman with
a dead-white face and scarlet lips, reminding me of cold veal and tomatoes.
The patron greeted Boris genially, and they talked together in Russian for a few
minutes. I stood in the background, preparing to tell some big lies about my experience
as a dishwasher.
Then the patron came over towards me. I shuffled uneasily, trying to look servile. Boris
had rubbed it into me that a plongeur is a slave's slave, and I expected the patron to
treat me like dirt. To my astonishment, he seized me warmly by the hand.
'So you are an Englishman!' he exclaimed. 'But how charming! I need not ask, then,
whether you are a golfer?'
'Mais certainement,' I said, seeing that this was expected of me.
'All my life I have wanted to play golf. Will you, my dear monsieur, be so kind as to show
me a few of the principal strokes?'
Apparently this was the Russian way of doing business. The patron listened attentively
while I explained the difference between a driver and an iron, and then suddenly
informed me that it was all entendu; Boris was to be maître d'hôtel when the restaurant
opened, and I plongeur, with a chance of rising to lavatory attendant if trade was good.
When would the restaurant open? I asked. 'Exactly a fortnight from today,'
the patron answered grandly (he had a manner of waving his hand and flicking off his
28
cigarette ash at the same time, which looked very grand), 'exactly a fortnight from
today, in time for lunch.' Then, with obvious pride, he showed us over the restaurant.
It was a smallish place, consisting of a bar, a dining-room, and a kitchen no bigger than
the average bathroom. The patron was decorating it in a trumpery 'picturesque' style
(he called it 'normand'; it was a matter of sham beams stuck on the plaster, and the like)
and proposed to call it the Auberge de Jehan Cottard, to give a medieval effect. He had
had a leaflet printed, full of lies about the historical associations of the quarter, and this
leaflet actually claimed, among other things, that there had once been an inn on the site
of the restaurant which was frequented by Charlemagne. The patron was very pleased
with this touch. He was also having the bar decorated with indecent pictures by an artist
from the Salon. Finally he gave us each an expensive cigarette, and after some more talk
we went home.
I felt strongly that we should never get any good from this restaurant. The patron had
looked to me like a cheat, and, what was worse, an incompetent cheat, and I had seen
two unmistakable duns hanging about the back door. But Boris, seeing himself a maître
d'hôtel once more, would not be discouraged.
'We've brought it off—only a fortnight to hold out. What is a fortnight? Food? Je m'en
fous. To think that in only three weeks I shall have my mistress! Will she be dark or fair,
I wonder? I don't mind, so long as she is not too thin.'
Two bad days followed. We had only sixty centimes left, and we spent it on half a pound
of bread, with a piece of garlic to rub it with. The point of rubbing garlic on bread is that
the taste lingers and gives one the illusion of having fed recently. We sat most of that
day in the Jardin des Plantes. Boris had shots with stones at the tame pigeons, but
always missed them, and after that we wrote dinner menus on the backs of envelopes.
We were too hungry even to try and think of anything except food. I remember the
dinner Boris finally selected for himself. It was: a dozen oysters, borscht soup (the red,
sweet, beetroot soup with cream on top), crayfishes, a young chicken en casserole, beef
with stewed plums, new potatoes, a salad, suet pudding and Roquefort cheese, with a
litre of Burgundy and some old brandy. Boris had international tastes in food. Later on,
when we were prosperous, I occasionally saw him eat meals almost as large without
difficulty.
When our money came to an end I stopped looking for work, and was another day
without food. I did not believe that the Auberge de Jehan Cottard was really going to
open, and I could see no other prospect, but I was too lazy to do anything but lie in bed.
Then the luck changed abruptly. At night, at about ten o'clock, I heard an eager shout
from the street. I got up and went to the window. Boris was there, waving his stick and
beaming. Before speaking he dragged a bent loaf from his pocket and threw it up to me.
'Mon ami, mon cher ami, we're saved! What do you think?'
'Surely you haven't got a job!'
'At the Hôtel X., near the Place de la Concorde—five hundred francs a month, and food. I
have been working there today. Name of Jesus Christ, how I have eaten!'
After ten or twelve hours' work, and with his game leg, his first thought had been to
walk three kilometres to my hotel and tell me the good news! What was more, he told
me to meet him in the Tuileries the next day during his afternoon interval, in case he
should be able to steal some food for me. At the appointed time I met Boris on a public
29
bench. He undid his waistcoat and produced a large, crushed newspaper packet; in it
were some minced veal, a wedge of Camembert cheese, bread and an éclair, all jumbled
together.
'Voilà!' said Boris, 'that's all I could smuggle out for you. The doorkeeper is a cunning
swine.'
It is disagreeable to eat out of a newspaper on a public seat, especially in the Tuileries,
which are generally full of pretty girls, but I was too hungry to care. While I ate, Boris
explained that he was working in the cafeterie of the hotel—that is, in English, the
stillroom. It appeared that the cafeterie was the very lowest post in the hotel, and a
dreadful come-down for a waiter, but it would do until the Auberge de Jehan Cottard
opened. Meanwhile I was to meet Boris every day in the Tuileries, and he would
smuggle out as much food as he dared. For three days we continued with this
arrangement, and I lived entirely on the stolen food. Then all our troubles came to an
end, for one of the plongeurs left the Hôtel X., and on Boris's recommendation I was
given a job there myself.
30
Chapter 10
The Hôtel X. was a vast grandiose place with a classical façade, and at one side a little
dark doorway like a rat-hole, which was the service entrance. I arrived at a quarter to
seven in the morning. A stream of men with greasy trousers were hurrying in and being
checked by a doorkeeper who sat in a tiny office. I waited, and presently the chef du
personnel, a sort of assistant manager, arrived and began to question me. He was an
Italian, with a round, pale face, haggard from overwork. He asked whether I was an
experienced dishwasher, and I said that I was; he glanced at my hands and saw that I
was lying, but on hearing that I was an Englishman he changed his tone and engaged
me.
'We have been looking for someone to practise our English on,' he said. 'Our clients are
all Americans, and the only English we know is —' He repeated something that little
boys write on the walls in London. 'You may be useful. Come downstairs.'
He led me down a winding staircase into a narrow passage, deep underground, and so
low that I had to stoop in places. It was stiflingly hot and very dark, with only dim
yellow bulbs several yards apart. There seemed to be miles of dark labyrinthine
passages—actually, I suppose, a few hundred yards in all—that reminded one queerly
of the lower decks of a liner; there were the same heat and cramped space and warm
reek of food, and a humming, whirring noise (it came from the kitchen furnaces) just
like the whir of engines. We passed doorways which let out sometimes a shouting of
oaths, sometimes the red glare of a fire, once a shuddering draught from an ice chamber.
As we went along, something struck me violently in the back. It was a hundred-pound
block of ice, carried by a blue-aproned porter. After him came a boy with a great slab of
veal on his shoulder, his cheek pressed into the damp, spongy flesh. They shoved me
aside with a cry of 'Range-toi, idiot!' and rushed on. On the wall, under one of the lights,
someone had written in a very neat hand: 'Sooner will you find a cloudless sky in
winter, than a woman at the Hôtel X. who has her maidenhead.' It seemed a queer sort
of place.
One of the passages branched off into a laundry, where an old skull-face woman gave
me a blue apron and a pile of dishcloths. Then the chef du personnel took me to a tiny
underground den—a cellar below a cellar, as it were—where there were a sink and
some gas-ovens. It was too low for me to stand quite upright, and the temperature was
perhaps 110 degrees Fahrenheit. The chef du personnel explained that my job was to
fetch meals for the higher hotel employees, who fed in a small dining-room above, clean
their room and wash their crockery. When he had gone, a waiter, another Italian, thrust
a fierce fuzzy head into the doorway and looked down at me.
'English, eh?' he said. 'Well, I'm in charge here. If you work well'—he made the motion
of up-ending a bottle and sucked noisily. 'If you don't'—he gave the doorpost several
vigorous kicks. 'To me, twisting your neck would be no more than spitting on the floor.
And if there's any trouble, they'll believe me, not you. So be careful.'
After this I set to work rather hurriedly. Except for about an hour, I was at work from
seven in the morning till a quarter-past nine at night; first at washing crockery, then at
31
scrubbing the tables and floors of the employees' dining-room, then at polishing glasses
and knives, then at fetching meals, then at washing crockery again, then at fetching
more meals and washing more crockery. It was easy work, and I got on well with it
except when I went to the kitchen to fetch meals. The kitchen was like nothing I had
ever seen or imagined—a stifling, low-ceilinged inferno of a cellar, red-lit from the fires,
and deafening with oaths and the clanging of pots and pans. It was so hot that all the
metal-work except the stoves had to be covered with cloth. In the middle were furnaces,
where twelve cooks skipped to and fro, their faces dripping sweat in spite of their white
caps. Round that were counters where a mob of waiters and plongeurs clamoured with
trays. Scullions, naked to the waist, were stoking the fires and scouring huge copper
saucepans with sand. Everyone seemed to be in a hurry and a rage. The head cook, a fine
scarlet man with big moustachios, stood in the middle booming continuously, 'Ça
marche, deux œufs brouillés! Ça marche, un Chateaubriand pommes sautées!' except when
he broke off to curse at a plongeur. There were three counters, and the first time I went
to the kitchen I took my tray unknowingly to the wrong one. The head cook walked up
to me, twisted his moustaches, and looked me up and down. Then he beckoned to the
breakfast cook and pointed at me.
'Do you see that? That is the type of plongeur they send us nowadays. Where do you
come from, idiot? From Charenton, I suppose?' (There is a large lunatic asylum at
Charenton.)
'From England,' I said.
'I might have known it. Well, mon cher monsieur l'Anglais, may I inform you that you are
the son of a whore? And now, fous-moi le camp to the other counter, where you belong.'
I got this kind of reception every time I went to the kitchen, for I always made some
mistake; I was expected to know the work, and was cursed accordingly. From curiosity I
counted the number of times I was called maquereau during the day, and it was thirtynine.
At half-past four the Italian told me that I could stop working, but that it was not worth
going out, as we began again at five. I went to the lavatory for a smoke; smoking was
strictly forbidden, and Boris had warned me that the lavatory was the only safe place.
After that I worked again till a quarter-past nine, when the waiter put his head into the
doorway and told me to leave the rest of the crockery. To my astonishment, after calling
me pig, mackerel, etc., all day, he had suddenly grown quite friendly. I realized that the
curses I had met with were only a kind of probation.
'That'll do, mon p'tit,' said the waiter. 'Tu n'es pas débrouillard, but you work all right.
Come up and have your dinner. The hotel allows us two litres of wine each, and I've
stolen another bottle. We'll have a fine booze.'
We had an excellent dinner from the leavings of the higher employees. The waiter,
grown mellow, told me stories about his love-affairs, and about two men whom he had
stabbed in Italy, and about how he had dodged his military service. He was a good
fellow when one got to know him; he reminded me of Benvenuto Cellini, somehow. I
was tired and drenched with sweat, but I felt a new man after a day's solid food. The
work did not seem difficult, and I felt that this job would suit me. It was not certain,
however, that it would continue, for I had been engaged as an 'extra' for the day only, at
twenty-five francs. The sour-faced doorkeeper counted out the money, less fifty
centimes which he said was for insurance (a lie, I discovered afterwards). Then he
32
stepped out into the passage, made me take off my coat, and carefully prodded me all
over, searching for stolen food. After this the chef du personnel appeared and spoke to
me. Like the waiter, he had grown more genial on seeing that I was willing to work.
'We will give you a permanent job if you like,' he said. 'The head waiter says he would
enjoy calling an Englishman names. Will you sign on for a month?'
Here was a job at last, and I was ready to jump at it. Then I remembered the Russian
restaurant, due to open in a fortnight. It seemed hardly fair to promise working a
month, and then leave in the middle. I said that I had other work in prospect—could I be
engaged for a fortnight? But at that the chef du personnel shrugged his shoulders and
said that the hotel only engaged men by the month. Evidently I had lost my chance of a
job.
Boris, by arrangement, was waiting for me in the Arcade of the Rue de Rivoli. When I
told him what had happened, he was furious. For the first time since I had known him he
forgot his manners and called me a fool.
'Idiot! Species of idiot! What's the good of my finding you a job when you go and chuck it
up the next moment? How could you be such a fool as to mention the other restaurant?
You'd only to promise you would work for a month.'
'It seemed more honest to say I might have to leave,' I objected.
'Honest! Honest! Who ever heard of a plongeur being honest? Mon ami'—suddenly he
seized my lapel and spoke very earnestly—'mon ami, you have worked here all day. You
see what hotel work is like. Do you think a plongeur can afford a sense of honour?'
'No, perhaps not.'
'Well, then, go back quickly and tell the chef du personnel you are quite ready to work for
a month. Say you will throw the other job over. Then, when our restaurant opens, we
have only to walk out.'
'But what about my wages if I break my contract?'
Boris banged his stick on the pavement and cried out at such stupidity. 'Ask to be paid
by the day, then you won't lose a sou. Do you suppose they would prosecute
a plongeur for breaking his contract? A plongeur is too low to be prosecuted.'
I hurried back, found the chef du personnel, and told him that I would work for a month,
whereat he signed me on. This was my first lesson in plongeur morality. Later I realized
how foolish it had been to have any scruples, for the big hotels are quite merciless
towards their employees. They engage or discharge men as the work demands, and they
all sack ten per cent or more of their staff when the season is over. Nor have they any
difficulty in replacing a man who leaves at short notice, for Paris is thronged by hotel
employees out of work.
33
Chapter 11
As it turned out, I did not break my contract, for it was six weeks before the Auberge de
Jehan Cottard even showed signs of opening. In the meantime I worked at the Hôtel X.,
four days a week in the cafeterie, one day helping the waiter on the fourth floor, and one
day replacing the woman who washed up for the dining-room. My day off, luckily, was
Sunday, but sometimes another man was ill and I had to work that day as well. The
hours were from seven in the morning till two in the afternoon, and from five in the
evening till nine—eleven hours; but it was a fourteen-hour day when I washed up for
the dining-room. By the ordinary standards of a Paris plongeur, these are exceptionally
short hours. The only hardship of the life was the fearful heat and stuffiness of those
labyrinthine cellars. Apart from this the hotel, which was large and well organized, was
considered a comfortable one.
Our cafeterie was a murky cellar measuring twenty feet by seven by eight high, and so
crowded with coffee-urns, bread-cutters and the like that one could hardly move
without banging against something. It was lighted by one dim electric bulb, and four or
five gas-fires that sent out a fierce red breath. There was a thermometer there, and the
temperature never fell below 110 degrees Fahrenheit—it neared 130 at some times of
the day. At one end were five service lifts, and at the other an ice cupboard where we
stored milk and butter. When you went into the ice cupboard you dropped a hundred
degrees of temperature at a single step; it used to remind me of the hymn about
Greenland's icy mountains and India's coral strand. Two men worked in
the cafeterie besides Boris and myself. One was Mario, a huge, excitable Italian—he was
like a city policeman with operatic gestures—and the other, a hairy, uncouth animal
whom we called the Magyar; I think he was a Transylvanian, or something even more
remote. Except the Magyar we were all big men, and at the rush hours we collided
incessantly.
The work in the cafeterie was spasmodic. We were never idle, but the real work only
came in bursts of two hours at a time—we called each burst 'un coup de feu'. The
first coup de feu came at eight, when the guests upstairs began to wake up and demand
breakfast. At eight a sudden banging and yelling would break out all through the
basement; bells rang on all sides, blue-aproned men rushed through the passages, our
service lifts came down with a simultaneous crash, and the waiters on all five floors
began shouting Italian oaths down the shafts. I don't remember all our duties, but they
included making tea, coffee and chocolate, fetching meals from the kitchen, wines from
the cellar, and fruit and so forth from the dining-room, slicing bread, making toast,
rolling pats of butter, measuring jam, opening milk-cans, counting lumps of sugar,
boiling eggs, cooking porridge, pounding ice, grinding coffee—all this for from a
hundred to two hundred customers. The kitchen was thirty yards away, and the diningroom sixty or seventy yards. Everything we sent up in the service lifts had to be covered
by a voucher, and the vouchers had to be carefully filed, and there was trouble if even a
lump of sugar was lost. Besides this, we had to supply the staff with bread and coffee,
and fetch the meals for the waiters upstairs. All in all, it was a complicated job.
34
I calculated that one had to walk and run about fifteen miles during the day, and yet the
strain of the work was more mental than physical. Nothing could be easier, on the face
of it, than this stupid scullion work, but it is astonishingly hard when one is in a hurry.
One has to leap to and fro between a multitude of jobs—it is like sorting a pack of cards
against the clock. You are, for example, making toast, when bang! down comes a service
lift with an order for tea, rolls and three different kinds of jam, and simultaneously
bang! down comes another demanding scrambled eggs, coffee and grapefruit; you run
to the kitchen for the eggs and to the dining-room for the fruit, going like lightning so as
to be back before your toast burns, and having to remember about the tea and coffee,
besides half a dozen other orders that are still pending; and at the same time some
waiter is following you and making trouble about a lost bottle of soda-water, and you
are arguing with him. It needs more brains than one might think. Mario said, no doubt
truly, that it took a year to make a reliable cafetier.
The time between eight and half-past ten was a sort of delirium. Sometimes we were
going as though we had only five minutes to live; sometimes there were sudden lulls
when the orders stopped and everything seemed quiet for a moment. Then we swept up
the litter from the floor, threw down fresh sawdust, and swallowed gallipots of wine or
coffee or water—anything, so long as it was wet. Very often we used to break off chunks
of ice and suck them while we worked. The heat among the gas-fires was nauseating; we
swallowed quarts of drink during the day, and after a few hours even our aprons were
drenched with sweat. At times we were hopelessly behind with the work, and some of
the customers would have gone without their breakfast, but Mario always pulled us
through. He had worked fourteen years in the cafeterie, and he had the skill that never
wastes a second between jobs. The Magyar was very stupid, and I was inexperienced,
and Boris was inclined to shirk, partly because of his lame leg, partly because he was
ashamed of working in the cafeterie after being a waiter; but Mario was wonderful. The
way he would stretch his great arms right across the cafeterie to fill a coffee-pot with
one hand and boil an egg with the other, at the same time watching toast and shouting
directions to the Magyar, and between whiles singing snatches from Rigoletto, was
beyond all praise. The patron knew his value, and he was paid a thousand francs a
month, instead of five hundred like the rest of us.
The breakfast pandemonium stopped at half-past ten. Then we scrubbed
the cafeterie tables, swept the floor and polished the brasswork, and, on good mornings,
went one at a time to the lavatory for a smoke. This was our slack time—only relatively
slack, however, for we had only ten minutes for lunch, and we never got through it
uninterrupted. The customers' luncheon hour, between twelve and two, was another
period of turmoil like the breakfast hour. Most of our work was fetching meals from the
kitchen, which meant constant engueulades from the cooks. By this time the cooks had
sweated in front of their furnaces for four or five hours, and their tempers were all
warmed up.
At two we were suddenly free men. We threw off our aprons and put on our coats,
hurried out of doors, and, when we had money, dived into the nearest bistro. It was
strange, coming up into the street from those firelit cellars. The air seemed blindingly
clear and cold, like arctic summer; and how sweet the petrol did smell, after the
stenches of sweat and food! Sometimes we met some of our cooks and waiters in
the bistros, and they were friendly and stood us drinks. Indoors we were their slaves,
but it is an etiquette in hotel life that between hours everyone is equal, and
the engueulades do not count.
35
At a quarter to five we went back to the hotel. Till half-past six there were no orders,
and we used this time to polish silver, clean out the coffee-urns, and do other odd jobs.
Then the grand turmoil of the day started—the dinner hour. I wish I could be Zola for a
little while, just to describe that dinner hour. The essence of the situation was that a
hundred or two hundred people were demanding individually different meals of five or
six courses, and that fifty or sixty people had to cook and serve them and clean up the
mess afterwards; anyone with experience of catering will know what that means. And at
this time when the work was doubled, the whole staff were tired out, and a number of
them were drunk. I could write pages about the scene without giving a true idea of it.
The chargings to and fro in the narrow passages, the collisions, the yells, the struggling
with crates and trays and blocks of ice, the heat, the darkness, the furious festering
quarrels which there was no time to fight out—they pass description. Anyone coming
into the basement for the first time would have thought himself in a den of maniacs. It
was only later, when I understood the working of the hotel, that I saw order in all this
chaos.
At half-past eight the work stopped very suddenly. We were not free till nine, but we
used to throw ourselves full length on the floor, and lie there resting our legs, too lazy
even to go to the ice cupboard for a drink. Sometimes the chef du personnel would come
in with bottles of beer, for the hotel stood us extra beer when we had had a hard day.
The food we were given was no more than eatable, but the patron was not mean about
drink; he allowed us two litres of wine a day each, knowing that if a plongeur is not
given two litres he will steal three. We had the heeltaps of bottles as well, so that we
often drank too much—a good thing, for one seemed to work faster when partially
drunk.
Four days of the week passed like this; of the other two working days, one was better
and one worse. After a week of this life I felt in need of a holiday. It was Saturday night,
so the people in our bistro were busy getting drunk, and with a free day ahead of me I
was ready to join them. We all went to bed, drunk, at two in the morning, meaning to
sleep till noon. At half-past five I was suddenly awakened. A night-watchman, sent from
the hotel, was standing at my bedside. He stripped the clothes back and shook me
roughly.
'Get up!' he said. 'Tu t'es bien saoulé la gueule, pas vrai? Well, never mind that, the hotel's
a man short. You've got to work today.'
'Why should I work?' I protested. 'This is my day off.'
'Day off, nothing! The work's got to be done. Get up!'
I got up and went out, feeling as though my back were broken and my skull filled with
hot cinders. I did not think that I could possibly do a day's work. And yet, after only an
hour in the basement, I found that I was perfectly well. It seemed that in the heat of
those cellars, as in a Turkish bath, one could sweat out almost any quantity of
drink. Plongeurs know this, and count on it. The power of swallowing quarts of wine,
and then sweating it out before it can do much damage, is one of the compensations of
their life.
36
Chapter 12
By far my best time at the hotel was when I went to help the waiter on the fourth floor.
We worked in a small pantry which communicated with the cafeterie by service lifts. It
was delightfully cool after the cellars, and the work was chiefly polishing silver and
glasses, which is a humane job. Valenti, the waiter, was a decent sort, and treated me
almost as an equal when we were alone, though he had to speak roughly when there
was anyone else present, for it does not do for a waiter to be friendly with plongeurs. He
used sometimes to tip me five francs when he had had a good day. He was a comely
youth, aged twenty-four but looking eighteen, and, like most waiters, he carried himself
well and knew how to wear his clothes. With his black tailcoat and white tie, fresh face
and sleek brown hair, he looked just like an Eton boy; yet he had earned his living since
he was twelve, and worked his way up literally from the gutter. Crossing the Italian
frontier without a passport, and selling chestnuts from a barrow on the northern
boulevards, and being given fifty days' imprisonment in London for working without a
permit, and being made love to by a rich old woman in a hotel, who gave him a diamond
ring and afterwards accused him of stealing it, were among his experiences. I used to
enjoy talking to him, at slack times when we sat smoking down the lift shaft.
My bad day was when I washed up for the dining-room. I had not to wash the plates,
which were done in the kitchen, but only the other crockery, silver, knives and glasses;
yet, even so, it meant thirteen hours' work, and I used between thirty and forty
dishcloths during the day. The antiquated methods used in France double the work of
washing up. Plate-racks are unheard-of, and there are no soap-flakes, only the treacly
soft soap, which refuses to lather in the hard Paris water. I worked in a dirty, crowded
little den, a pantry and scullery combined, which gave straight on the dining-room.
Besides washing up, I had to fetch the waiters' food and serve them at table; most of
them were intolerably insolent, and I had to use my fists more than once to get common
civility. The person who normally washed up was a woman, and they made her life a
misery.
It was amusing to look round the filthy little scullery and think that only a double door
was between us and the dining-room. There sat the customers in all their splendour—
spotless table-cloths, bowls of flowers, mirrors and gilt cornices and painted cherubim;
and here, just a few feet away, we in our disgusting filth. For it really was disgusting
filth. There was no time to sweep the floor till evening, and we slithered about in a
compound of soapy water, lettuce-leaves, torn paper and trampled food. A dozen
waiters with their coats off, showing their sweaty armpits, sat at the table mixing salads
and sticking their thumbs into the cream pots. The room had a dirty mixed smell of food
and sweat. Everywhere in the cupboards, behind the piles of crockery, were squalid
stores of food that the waiters had stolen. There were only two sinks, and no washing
basin, and it was nothing unusual for a waiter to wash his face in the water in which
clean crockery was rinsing. But the customers saw nothing of this. There were a coconut mat and a mirror outside the dining-room door, and the waiters used to preen
themselves up and go in looking the picture of cleanliness.
37
It is an instructive sight to see a waiter going into a hotel dining-room. As he passes the
door a sudden change comes over him. The set of his shoulders alters; all the dirt and
hurry and irritation have dropped off in an instant. He glides over the carpet, with a
solemn priest-like air. I remember our assistant maître d'hôtel, a fiery Italian, pausing at
the dining-room door to address an apprentice who had broken a bottle of wine.
Shaking his fist above his head he yelled (luckily the door was more or less soundproof):
'Tu me fais chier. Do you call yourself a waiter, you young bastard? You a waiter! You're
not fit to scrub floors in the brothel your mother came from. Maquereau!'
Words failing him, he turned to the door; and as he opened it he farted loudly, a
favourite Italian insult.
Then he entered the dining-room and sailed across it dish in hand, graceful as a swan.
Ten seconds later he was bowing reverently to a customer. And you could not help
thinking, as you saw him bow and smile, with that benign smile of the trained waiter,
that the customer was put to shame by having such an aristocrat to serve him.
This washing up was a thoroughly odious job—not hard, but boring and silly beyond
words. It is dreadful to think that some people spend whole decades at such
occupations. The woman whom I replaced was quite sixty years old, and she stood at
the sink thirteen hours a day, six days a week, the year round; she was, in addition,
horribly bullied by the waiters. She gave out that she had once been an actress—
actually, I imagine, a prostitute; most prostitutes end as charwomen. It was strange to
see that in spite of her age and her life she still wore a bright blonde wig, and darkened
her eyes and painted her face like a girl of twenty. So apparently even a seventy-eighthour week can leave one with some vitality.
38
Chapter 13
On my third day at the hotel the chef du personnel, who had generally spoken to me in
quite a pleasant tone, called me up and said sharply:
'Here, you, shave that moustache off at once! Nom de Dieu, who ever heard of
a plongeur with a moustache?'
I began to protest, but he cut me short. 'A plongeur with a moustache—nonsense! Take
care I don't see you with it tomorrow.'
On the way home I asked Boris what this meant. He shrugged his shoulders. 'You must
do what he says, mon ami. No one in a hotel wears a moustache, except the cooks. I
should have thought you would have noticed it. Reason? There is no reason. It is the
custom.'
I saw that it was an etiquette, like not wearing a white tie with a dinner-jacket, and
shaved off my moustache. Afterwards I found out the explanation of the custom, which
is this: waiters in good hotels do not wear moustaches, and to show their superiority
they decree that plongeurs shall not wear them either; and the cooks wear their
moustaches to show their contempt for the waiters.
This gives some idea of the elaborate caste system existing in a hotel. Our staff,
amounting to about a hundred and ten, had their prestige graded as accurately as that of
soldiers, and a cook or waiter was as much above a plongeur as a captain above a
private. Highest of all came the manager, who could sack anybody, even the cooks. We
never saw the patron, and all we knew of him was that his meals had to be prepared
more carefully than those of the customers; all the discipline of the hotel depended on
the manager. He was a conscientious man, and always on the lookout for slackness, but
we were too clever for him. A system of service bells ran through the hotel, and the
whole staff used these for signalling to one another. A long ring and a short ring,
followed by two more long rings, meant that the manager was coming, and when we
heard it we took care to look busy.
Below the manager came the maître d'hôtel. He did not serve at table, unless to a lord or
someone of that kind, but directed the other waiters and helped with the catering. His
tips, and his bonus from the champagne companies (it was two francs for each cork he
returned to them), came to two hundred francs a day. He was in a position quite apart
from the rest of the staff, and took his meals in a private room, with silver on the table
and two apprentices in clean white jackets to serve him. A little below the head waiter
came the head cook, drawing about five thousand francs a month; he dined in the
kitchen, but at a separate table, and one of the apprentice cooks waited on him. Then
came the chef du personnel; he drew only fifteen hundred francs a month, but he wore a
black coat and did no manual work, and he could sack plongeurs and fine waiters. Then
came the other cooks, drawing anything between three thousand and seven hundred
and fifty francs a month; then the waiters, making about seventy francs a day in tips,
besides a small retaining fee; then the laundresses and sewing-women; then the
apprentice waiters, who received no tips, but were paid seven hundred and fifty francs a
month; then the plongeurs, also at seven hundred and fifty francs; then the
39
chambermaids, at five or six hundred francs a month; and lastly the cafetiers, at five
hundred a month. We of the cafeterie were the very dregs of the hotel, despised
and tutoied by everyone.
There were various others—the office employees, called generally couriers, the
storekeeper, the cellarman, some porters and pages, the ice man, the bakers, the
nightwatchman, the doorkeeper. Different jobs were done by different races. The office
employees and the cooks and sewing-women were French, the waiters Italians and
Germans (there is hardly such a thing as a French waiter in Paris), the plongeurs of
every race in Europe, besides Arabs and negroes. French was the lingua franca, even the
Italians speaking it to one another.
All the departments had their special perquisites. In all Paris hotels it is the custom to
sell the broken bread to bakers for eight sous a pound, and the kitchen scraps to
pigkeepers for a trifle, and to divide the proceeds of this among the plongeurs. There
was much pilfering, too. The waiters all stole food—in fact, I seldom saw a waiter
trouble to eat the rations provided for him by the hotel—and the cooks did it on a larger
scale in the kitchen, and we in the cafeterie swilled illicit tea and coffee. The cellarman
stole brandy. By a rule of the hotel the waiters were not allowed to keep stores of
spirits, but had to go to the cellarman for each drink as it was ordered. As the cellarman
poured out the drinks he would set aside perhaps a teaspoonful from each glass, and he
amassed quantities in this way. He would sell you the stolen brandy for five sous a swig
if he thought he could trust you.
There were thieves among the staff, and if you left money in your coat pockets it was
generally taken. The doorkeeper, who paid our wages and searched us for stolen food,
was the greatest thief in the hotel. Out of my five hundred francs a month, this man
actually managed to cheat me of a hundred and fourteen francs in six weeks. I had asked
to be paid daily, so the doorkeeper paid me sixteen francs each evening, and, by not
paying for Sundays (for which of course payment was due), pocketed sixty-four francs.
Also, I sometimes worked on a Sunday, for which, though I did not know it, I was
entitled to an extra twenty-five francs. The doorkeeper never paid this either, and so
made away with another seventy-five francs. I only realized during my last week that I
was being cheated, and, as I could prove nothing, only twenty-five francs were refunded.
The doorkeeper played similar tricks on any employee who was fool enough to be taken
in. He called himself a Greek, but in reality he was an Armenian. After knowing him I
saw the force of the proverb 'Trust a snake before a Jew and a Jew before a Greek, but
don't trust an Armenian.'
There were queer characters among the waiters. One was a gentleman—a youth who
had been educated at a university, and had had a well-paid job in a business office. He
had caught a venereal disease, lost his job, drifted, and now considered himself lucky to
be a waiter. Many of the waiters had slipped into France without passports, and one or
two of them were spies—it is a common profession for a spy to adopt. One day there
was a fearful row in the waiters' dining-room between Morandi, a dangerous-looking
man with eyes set too far apart, and another Italian. It appeared that Morandi had taken
the other man's mistress. The other man, a weakling and obviously frightened of
Morandi, was threatening vaguely.
Morandi jeered at him. 'Well, what are you going to do about it? I've slept with your girl,
slept with her three times. It was fine. What can you do, eh?'
'I can denounce you to the secret police. You are an Italian spy.'
40
Morandi did not deny it. He simply produced a razor from his tail pocket and made two
swift strokes in the air, as though slashing a man's cheeks open. Whereat the other
waiter took it back.
The queerest type I ever saw in the hotel was an 'extra'. He had been engaged at twentyfive francs for the day to replace the Magyar, who was ill. He was a Serbian, a thick-set
nimble fellow of about twenty-five, speaking six languages, including English. He
seemed to know all about hotel work, and up till midday he worked like a slave. Then, as
soon as it had struck twelve, he turned sulky, shirked his work, stole wine, and finally
crowned all by loafing about openly with a pipe in his mouth. Smoking, of course, was
forbidden under severe penalties. The manager himself heard of it and came down to
interview the Serbian, fuming with rage.
'What the devil do you mean by smoking here?' he cried.
'What the devil do you mean by having a face like that?' answered the Serbian, calmly.
I cannot convey the blasphemy of such a remark. The head cook, if a plongeur had
spoken to him like that, would have thrown a saucepan of hot soup in his face. The
manager said instantly, 'You're sacked!' and at two o'clock the Serbian was given his
twenty-five francs and duly sacked. Before he went out Boris asked him in Russian what
game he was playing. He said the Serbian answered:
'Look here, mon vieux, they've got to pay me a day's wages if I work up to midday,
haven't they? That's the law. And where's the sense of working after I get my wages? So
I'll tell you what I do. I go to a hotel and get a job as an extra, and up to midday I work
hard. Then, the moment it's struck twelve, I start raising such hell that they've no choice
but to sack me. Neat, eh? Most days I'm sacked by half-past twelve; today it was two
o'clock; but I don't care, I've saved four hours' work. The only trouble is, one can't do it
at the same hotel twice.'
It appeared that he had played this game at half the hotels and restaurants in Paris. It is
probably quite an easy game to play during the summer, though the hotels protect
themselves against it as well as they can by means of a black list.
41
Chapter 14
In a few days I had grasped the main principles on which the hotel was run. The thing
that would astonish anyone coming for the first time into the service quarters of a hotel
would be the fearful noise and disorder during the rush hours. It is something so
different from the steady work in a shop or a factory that it looks at first sight like mere
bad management. But it is really quite unavoidable, and for this reason Hotel work is
not particularly hard, but by its nature it comes in rushes and cannot be economized.
You cannot, for instance, grill a steak two hours before it is wanted; you have to wait till
the last moment, by which time a mass of other work has accumulated, and then do it all
together, in frantic haste. The result is that at mealtimes everyone is doing two men's
work, which is impossible without noise and quarrelling. Indeed the quarrels are a
necessary part of the process, for the pace would never be kept up if everyone did not
accuse everyone else of idling. It was for this reason that during the rush hours the
whole staff raged and cursed like demons. At those times there was scarcely a verb in
the hotel except foutre. A girl in the bakery, aged sixteen, used oaths that would have
defeated a cabman. (Did not Hamlet say 'cursing like a scullion'? No doubt Shakespeare
had watched scullions at work.) But we were not losing our heads and wasting time; we
were just stimulating one another for the effort of packing four hours' work into two
hours.
What keeps a hotel going is the fact that the employees take a genuine pride in their
work, beastly and silly though it is. If a man idles, the others soon find him out, and
conspire against him to get him sacked. Cooks, waiters and plongeurs differ greatly in
outlook, but they are all alike in being proud of their efficiency.
Undoubtedly the most workmanlike class, and the least servile, are the cooks. They do
not earn quite so much as waiters, but their prestige is higher and their employment
steadier. The cook does not look upon himself as a servant, but as a skilled workman; he
is generally called 'un ouvrier', which a waiter never is. He knows his power—knows
that he alone makes or mars a restaurant, and that if he is five minutes late everything is
out of gear. He despises the whole non-cooking staff, and makes it a point of honour to
insult everyone below the head waiter. And he takes a genuine artistic pride in his work,
which demands very great skill. It is not the cooking that is so difficult, but the doing
everything to time. Between breakfast and luncheon the head cook at the Hôtel X. would
receive orders for several hundred dishes, all to be served at different times; he cooked
few of them himself, but he gave instructions about all of them and inspected them
before they were sent up. His memory was wonderful. The vouchers were pinned on a
board, but the head cook seldom looked at them; everything was stored in his mind, and
exactly to the minute, as each dish fell due, he would call out, 'Faites marcher une
côtelette de veau' (or whatever it was) unfailingly. He was an insufferable bully, but he
was also an artist. It is for their punctuality, and not for any superiority in technique,
that men cooks are preferred to women.
The waiter's outlook is quite different. He too is proud in a way of his skill, but his skill
is chiefly in being servile. His work gives him the mentality, not of a workman, but of a
snob. He lives perpetually in sight of rich people, stands at their tables, listens to their
42
conversation, sucks up to them with smiles and discreet little jokes. He has the pleasure
of spending money by proxy. Moreover, there is always the chance that he may become
rich himself, for, though most waiters die poor, they have long runs of luck occasionally.
At some cafes on the Grand Boulevard there is so much money to be made that the
waiters actually pay the patron for their employment. The result is that between
constantly seeing money, and hoping to get it, the waiter comes to identify himself to
some extent with his employers. He will take pains to serve a meal in style, because he
feels that he is participating in the meal himself.
I remember Valenti telling me of some banquet at Nice at which he had once served, and
of how it cost two hundred thousand francs and was talked of for months afterwards. 'It
was splendid, mon p'tit, mais magnifique! Jesus Christ! The champagne, the silver, the
orchids—I have never seen anything like them, and I have seen some things. Ah, it was
glorious!'
'But,' I said, 'you were only there to wait?'
'Oh, of course. But still, it was splendid.'
The moral is, never be sorry for a waiter. Sometimes when you sit in a restaurant, still
stuffing yourself half an hour after closing time, you feel that the tired waiter at your
side must surely be despising you. But he is not. He is not thinking as he looks at you,
'What an overfed lout'; he is thinking, 'One day, when I have saved enough money, I
shall be able to imitate that man.' He is ministering to a kind of pleasure he thoroughly
understands and admires. And that is why waiters are seldom Socialists, have no
effective trade union, and will work twelve hours a day—they work fifteen hours, seven
days a week, in many cafés. They are snobs, and they find the servile nature of their
work rather congenial.
The plongeurs, again, have a different outlook. Theirs is a job which offers no prospects,
is intensely exhausting, and at the same time has not a trace of skill or interest; the sort
of job that would always be done by women if women were strong enough. All that is
required of them is to be constantly on the run, and to put up with long hours and a
stuffy atmosphere. They have no way of escaping from this life, for they cannot save a
penny from their wages, and working from sixty to a hundred hours a week leaves them
no time to train for anything else. The best they can hope is to find a slightly softer job
as night-watchman or lavatory attendant.
And yet the plongeurs, low as they are, also have a kind of pride. It is the pride of the
drudge—the man who is equal to no matter what quantity of work. At that level, the
mere power to go on working like an ox is about the only virtue
attainable. Débrouillard is what every plongeur wants to be called. A débrouillard is a
man who, even when he is told to do the impossible, will se débrouiller—get it done
somehow. One of the kitchen plongeurs at the Hôtel X., a German, was well known as
a débrouillard. One night an English lord came to the hotel, and the waiters were in
despair, for the lord had asked for peaches, and there were none in stock; it was late at
night, and the shops would be shut. 'Leave it to me,' said the German. He went out, and
in ten minutes he was back with four peaches. He had gone into a neighbouring
restaurant and stolen them. That is what is meant by a débrouillard. The English lord
paid for the peaches at twenty francs each.
Mario, who was in charge of the cafeterie, had the typical drudge mentality. All he
thought of was getting through the 'boulot', and he defied you to give him too much of it.
43
Fourteen years underground had left him with about as much natural laziness as a
piston rod. 'Faut être un dur,' he used to say when anyone complained. You will often
hear plongeurs boast, 'Je suis un dur'—as though they were soldiers, not male
charwomen.
Thus everyone in the hotel had his sense of honour, and when the press of work came
we were all ready for a grand concerted effort to get through it. The constant war
between the different departments also made for efficiency, for everyone clung to his
own privileges and tried to stop the others idling and pilfering.
This is the good side of hotel work. In a hotel a huge and complicated machine is kept
running by an inadequate staff, because every man has a well-defined job and does it
scrupulously. But there is a weak point, and it is this—that the job the staff are doing is
not necessarily what the customer pays for. The customer pays, as he sees it, for good
service; the employee is paid, as he sees it, for the boulot—meaning, as a rule, an
imitation of good service. The result is that, though hotels are miracles of punctuality,
they are worse than the worst private houses in the things that matter.
Take cleanliness, for example. The dirt in the Hôtel X., as soon as one penetrated into the
service quarters, was revolting. Our cafeterie had year-old filth in all the dark corners,
and the bread-bin was infested with cockroaches. Once I suggested killing these beasts
to Mario. 'Why kill the poor animals?' he said reproachfully. The others laughed when I
wanted to wash my hands before touching the butter. Yet we were clean where we
recognized cleanliness as part of the boulot. We scrubbed the tables and polished the
brasswork regularly, because we had orders to do that; but we had no orders to be
genuinely clean, and in any case we had no time for it. We were simply carrying out our
duties; and as our first duty was punctuality, we saved time by being dirty.
In the kitchen the dirt was worse. It is not a figure of speech, it is a mere statement of
fact to say that a French cook will spit in the soup—that is, if he is not going to drink it
himself. He is an artist, but his art is not cleanliness. To a certain extent he is even dirty
because he is an artist, for food, to look smart, needs dirty treatment. When a steak, for
instance, is brought up for the head cook's inspection, he does not handle it with a fork.
He picks it up in his fingers and slaps it down, runs his thumb round the dish and licks it
to taste the gravy, runs it round and licks it again, then steps back and contemplates the
piece of meat like an artist judging a picture, then presses it lovingly into place with his
fat, pink fingers, every one of which he has licked a hundred times that morning. When
he is satisfied, he takes a cloth and wipes his fingerprints from the dish, and hands it to
the waiter. And the waiter, of course, dips his fingers into the gravy—his nasty, greasy
fingers which he is for ever running through his brilliantined hair. Whenever one pays
more than, say, ten francs for a dish of meat in Paris, one may be certain that it has been
fingered in this manner. In very cheap restaurants it is different; there, the same trouble
is not taken over the food, and it is just forked out of the pan and flung onto a plate,
without handling. Roughly speaking, the more one pays for food, the more sweat and
spittle one is obliged to eat with it.
Dirtiness is inherent in hotels and restaurants, because sound food is sacrificed to
punctuality and smartness. The hotel employee is too busy getting food ready to
remember that it is meant to be eaten. A meal is simply 'une commande' to him, just as a
man dying of cancer is simply 'a case' to the doctor. A customer orders, for example, a
piece of toast. Somebody, pressed with work in a cellar deep underground, has to
prepare it. How can he stop and say to himself, 'This toast is to be eaten—I must make it
44
eatable'? All he knows is that it must look right and must be ready in three minutes.
Some large drops of sweat fall from his forehead onto the toast. Why should he worry?
Presently the toast falls among the filthy sawdust on the floor. Why trouble to make a
new piece? It is much quicker to wipe the sawdust off. On the way upstairs the toast falls
again, butter side down. Another wipe is all it needs. And so with everything. The only
food at the Hôtel X. which was ever prepared cleanly was the staff's, and the patron's.
The maxim, repeated by everyone, was: 'Look out for the patron, and as for the
clients, s'en fout pas mal!' Everywhere in the service quarters dirt festered—a secret
vein of dirt, running through the great garish hotel like the intestines through a man's
body.
Apart from the dirt, the patron swindled the customers wholeheartedly. For the most
part the materials of the food were very bad, though the cooks knew how to serve it up
in style. The meat was at best ordinary, and as to the vegetables, no good housekeeper
would have looked at them in the market. The cream, by a standing order, was diluted
with milk. The tea and coffee were of inferior sorts, and the jam was synthetic stuff out
of vast unlabelled tins. All the cheaper wines, according to Boris, were corked vin
ordinaire. There was a rule that employees must pay for anything they spoiled, and in
consequence damaged things were seldom thrown away. Once the waiter on the third
floor dropped a roast chicken down the shaft of our service lift, where it fell into a litter
of broken bread, torn paper and so forth at the bottom. We simply wiped it with a cloth
and sent it up again. Upstairs there were dirty tales of once-used sheets not being
washed, but simply damped, ironed and put back on the beds. The patron was as mean
to us as to the customers. Throughout that vast hotel there was not, for instance, such a
thing as a brush and pan; one had to manage with a broom and a piece of cardboard.
And the staff lavatory was worthy of Central Asia, and there was no place to wash one's
hands, except the sinks used for washing crockery.
In spite of all this the Hôtel X. was one of the dozen most expensive hotels in Paris, and
the customers paid startling prices. The ordinary charge for a night's lodging, not
including breakfast, was two hundred francs. All wine and tobacco were sold at exactly
double shop prices, though of course the patron bought at the wholesale price. If a
customer had a title, or was reputed to be a millionaire, all his charges went up
automatically. One morning on the fourth floor an American who was on diet wanted
only salt and hot water for his breakfast. Valenti was furious. 'Jesus Christ!' he said,
'what about my ten per cent? Ten per cent of salt and water!' And he charged twentyfive francs for the breakfast. The customer paid without a murmur.
According to Boris, the same kind of thing went on in all Paris hotels, or at least in all the
big, expensive ones. But I imagine that the customers at the Hôtel X. were especially
easy to swindle, for they were mostly Americans, with a sprinkling of English—no
French—and seemed to know nothing whatever about good food. They would stuff
themselves with disgusting American 'cereals', and eat marmalade at tea, and drink
vermouth after dinner, and order a poulet à la reine at a hundred francs and then souse
it in Worcester sauce. One customer, from Pittsburg, dined every night in his bedroom
on grape-nuts, scrambled eggs and cocoa. Perhaps it hardly matters whether such
people are swindled or not.
45
Chapter 15
I heard queer tales in the hotel. There were tales of dope fiends, of old debauchees who
frequented hotels in search of pretty page-boys, of thefts and blackmail. Mario told me
of a hotel in which he had been, where a chambermaid stole a priceless diamond ring
from an American lady. For days the staff were searched as they left work, and two
detectives searched the hotel from top to bottom, but the ring was never found. The
chambermaid had a lover in the bakery, and he had baked the ring into a roll, where it
lay unsuspected until the search was over.
Once Valenti, at a slack time, told me a story about himself.
'You know, mon p'tit, this hotel life is all very well, but it's the devil when you're out of
work. I expect you know what it is to go without eating, eh? Forcément, otherwise you
wouldn't be scrubbing dishes. Well, I'm not a poor devil of a plongeur; I'm a waiter,
and I went five days without eating, once. Five days without even a crust of bread—
Jesus Christ!
'I tell you, those five days were the devil. The only good thing was, I had my rent paid in
advance. I was living in a dirty, cheap little hotel in the Rue Sainte Éloïse up in the Latin
quarter. It was called the Hôtel —, after some famous prostitute who was born in that
quarter, I expect. I was starving, and there was nothing I could do; I couldn't even go to
the cafés where the hotel proprietors come to engage waiters, because I hadn't the price
of a drink. All I could do was to lie in bed getting weaker and weaker, and watching the
bugs running about the ceiling. I don't want to go through that again, I can tell you.
'In the afternoon of the fifth day I went half mad; at least, that's how it seems to me now.
There was an old faded print of a woman's head hanging on the wall of my room, and I
took to wondering who it could be; and after about an hour I realized that it must be
Sainte Éloïse, who was the patron saint of the quarter. I had never taken any notice of
the thing before, but now, as I lay staring at it, a most extraordinary idea came into my
head.
'"Écoute, mon cher," I said to myself, "you'll be starving to death if this goes on much
longer. You've got to do something. Why not try a prayer to Sainte Éloïse? Go down on
your knees and ask her to send you some money. After all, it can't do any harm. Try it!"
'Mad, eh? Still, a man will do anything when he's hungry. Besides, as I said, it couldn't do
any harm. I got out of bed and began praying. I said:
'"Dear Sainte Éloïse, if you exist, please send me some money. I don't ask for much—just
enough to buy some bread and a bottle of wine and get my strength back. Three or four
francs would do. You don't know how grateful I'll be, Sainte Éloïse, if you help me this
once. And be sure, if you send me anything, the first thing I'll do will be to go and burn a
candle for you, at your church down the street. Amen."
'I put in that about the candle, because I had heard that saints like having candles burnt
in their honour. I meant to keep my promise, of course. But I am an atheist and I didn't
really believe that anything would come of it.
46
'Well, I got into bed again, and five minutes later there came a bang at the door. It was a
girl called Maria, a big fat peasant girl who lived at our hotel. She was a very stupid girl,
but a good sort, and I didn't much care for her to see me in the state I was in.
'She cried out at the sight of me. "Nom de Dieu!" she said, "what's the matter with you?
What are you doing in bed at this time of day? T'en as une mine! You look more like a
corpse than a man."
'Probably I did look a sight. I had been five days without food, most of the time in bed,
and it was three days since I had had a wash or a shave. The room was a regular pigsty,
too.
'"What's the matter?" said Maria again.
'"The matter!" I said; "Jesus Christ! I'm starving. I haven't eaten for five days. That's
what's the matter."
'Maria was horrified. "Not eaten for five days?" she said. "But why? Haven't you any
money, then?"
'"Money!" I said. "Do you suppose I should be starving if I had money? I've got just five
sous in the world, and I've pawned everything. Look round the room and see if there's
anything more I can sell or pawn. If you can find anything that will fetch fifty centimes,
you're cleverer than I am."
'Maria began looking round the room. She poked here and there among a lot of rubbish
that was lying about, and then suddenly she got quite excited. Her great thick mouth fell
open with astonishment.
'"You idiot!" she cried out. "Imbecile! What's this, then?"
'I saw that she had picked up an empty oil bidon that had been lying in the corner. I had
bought it weeks before, for an oil lamp I had before I sold my things.
'"That?" I said. "That's an oil bidon. What about it?"
'"Imbecile! Didn't you pay three francs fifty deposit on it?"
'Now, of course I had paid the three francs fifty. They always make you pay a deposit on
the bidon, and you get it back when the bidon is returned. But I'd forgotten all about it.
'"Yes—" I began.
'"Idiot!" shouted Maria again. She got so excited that she began to dance about until I
thought her sabots would go through the floor. "Idiot! T'es louf! T'es louf! What have you
got to do but take it back to the shop and get your deposit back? Starving, with three
francs fifty staring you in the face! Imbecile!"
'I can hardly believe now that in all those five days I had never once thought of taking
the bidon back to the shop. As good as three francs fifty in hard cash, and it had never
occurred to me! I sat up in bed. "Quick!" I shouted to Maria, "you take it for me. Take it
to the grocer's at the corner—run like the devil. And bring back food!"
'Maria didn't need to be told. She grabbed the bidon and went clattering down the stairs
like a herd of elephants, and in three minutes she was back with two pounds of bread
under one arm and a half-litre bottle of wine under the other. I didn't stop to thank her;
I just seized the bread and sank my teeth in it. Have you noticed how bread tastes when
you have been hungry for a long time? Cold, wet, doughy—like putty almost. But, Jesus
47
Christ, how good it was! As for the wine, I sucked it all down in one draught, and it
seemed to go straight into my veins and flow round my body like new blood. Ah, that
made a difference!
'I wolfed the whole two pounds of bread without stopping to take breath. Maria stood
with her hands on her hips, watching me eat. "Well, you feel better, eh?" she said when I
had finished.
'"Better!" I said. "I feel perfect! I'm not the same man as I was five minutes ago. There's
only one thing in the world I need now—a cigarette."
'Maria put her hand in her apron pocket. "You can't have it," she said. "I've no money.
This is all I had left out of your three francs fifty—seven sous. It's no good; the cheapest
cigarettes are twelve sous a packet."
'"Then I can have them!" I said. "Jesus Christ, what a piece of luck! I've got five sous—it's
just enough."
'Maria took the twelve sous and was starting out to the tobacconist's. And then
something I had forgotten all this time came into my head. There was that cursed Sainte
Éloïse! I had promised her a candle if she sent me money; and really, who could say that
the prayer hadn't come true? "Three or four francs," I had said; and the next moment
along came three francs fifty. There was no getting away from it. I should have to spend
my twelve sous on a candle.
'I called Maria back. "It's no use," I said; "there is Sainte Éloïse—I have promised her a
candle. The twelve sous will have to go on that. Silly, isn't it? I can't have my cigarettes
after all."
'"Sainte Éloïse?" said Maria. "What about Sainte Éloïse?"
'"I prayed to her for money and promised her a candle," I said. "She answered the
prayer—at any rate, the money turned up. I shall have to buy that candle. It's a nuisance,
but it seems to me I must keep my promise."
'"But what put Sainte Éloïse into your head?" said Maria.
"It was her picture," I said, and I explained the whole thing. "There she is, you see," I
said, and I pointed to the picture on the wall.
'Maria looked at the picture, and then to my surprise she burst into shouts of laughter.
She laughed more and more, stamping about the room and holding her fat sides as
though they would burst. I thought she had gone mad. It was two minutes before she
could speak.
'"Idiot!" she cried at last. "T'es louf! T'es louf! Do you mean to tell me you really knelt
down and prayed to that picture? Who told you it was Sainte Éloïse?"
'"But I made sure it was Sainte Éloïse!" I said.
'"Imbecile! It isn't Sainte Éloïse at all. Who do you think it is?"
'"Who?" I said.
'"It is —, the woman this hotel is called after."
'I had been praying to —, the famous prostitute of the Empire . . .
48
'But, after all, I wasn't sorry. Maria and I had a good laugh, and then we talked it over,
and we made out that I didn't owe Sainte Éloïse anything. Clearly it wasn't she who had
answered the prayer, and there was no need to buy her a candle. So I had my packet of
cigarettes after all.'
49
Chapter 16
Time went on and the Auberge de Jehan Cottart showed no signs of opening. Boris and I
went down there one day during our afternoon interval and found that none of the
alterations had been done, except the indecent pictures, and there were three duns
instead of two. The patron greeted us with his usual blandness, and the next instant
turned to me (his prospective dishwasher) and borrowed five francs. After that I felt
certain that the restaurant would never get beyond talk. The patron, however, again
named the opening for 'exactly a fortnight from today', and introduced us to the woman
who was to do the cooking, a Baltic Russian five feet tall and a yard across the hips. She
told us that she had been a singer before she came down to cooking, and that she was
very artistic and adored English literature, especially La Case de l'Oncle Tom.
In a fortnight I had got so used to the routine of a plongeur's life that I could hardly
imagine anything different. It was a life without much variation. At a quarter to six one
woke with a sudden start, tumbled into grease-stiffened clothes, and hurried out with
dirty face and protesting muscles. It was dawn, and the windows were dark except for
the workmen's cafés. The sky was like a vast flat wall of cobalt, with roofs and spires of
black paper pasted upon it. Drowsy men were sweeping the pavements with ten-foot
besoms, and ragged families picking over the dustbins. Workmen, and girls with a piece
of chocolate in one hand and a croissant in the other, were pouring into the Metro
stations. Trams, filled with more workmen, boomed gloomily past. One hastened down
to the station, fought for a place—one does literally have to fight on the Paris Metro at
six in the morning—and stood jammed in the swaying mass of passengers, nose to nose
with some hideous French face, breathing sour wine and garlic. And then one descended
into the labyrinth of the hotel basement, and forgot daylight till two o'clock, when the
sun was hot and the town black with people and cars.
After my first week at the hotel I always spent the afternoon interval in sleeping, or,
when I had money, in a bistro. Except for a few ambitious waiters who went to English
classes, the whole staff wasted their leisure in this way; one seemed too lazy after the
morning's work to do anything better. Sometimes half a dozen plongeurs would make
up a party and go to an abominable brothel in the Rue de Sieyès, where the charge was
only five francs twenty-five centimes—tenpence halfpenny. It was nick-named 'le prix
fixe', and they used to describe their experiences there as a great joke. It was a favourite
rendezvous of hotel workers. The plongeurs' wages did not allow them to marry, and no
doubt work in the basement does not encourage fastidious feelings.
For another four hours one was in the cellars, and then one emerged, sweating, into the
cool street. It was lamplight—that strange purplish gleam of the Paris lamps—and
beyond the river the Eiffel Tower flashed from top to bottom with zigzag skysigns, like
enormous snakes of fire. Streams of cars glided silently to and fro, and women,
exquisite-looking in the dim light, strolled up and down the arcade. Sometimes a woman
would glance at Boris or me, and then, noticing our greasy clothes, look hastily away
again. One fought another battle in the Metro and was home by ten. Generally from ten
to midnight I went to a little bistro in our street, an underground place frequented by
Arab navvies. It was a bad place for fights, and I sometimes saw bottles thrown, once
50
with fearful effect, but as a rule the Arabs fought among themselves and let Christians
alone. Raki, the Arab drink, was very cheap, and the bistro was open at all hours, for the
Arabs—lucky men—had the power of working all day and drinking all night.
It was the typical life of a plongeur, and it did not seem a bad life at the time. I had no
sensation of poverty, for even after paying my rent and setting aside enough for tobacco
and journeys and my food on Sundays, I still had four francs a day for drinks, and four
francs was wealth. There was—it is hard to express it—a sort of heavy contentment, the
contentment a well-fed beast might feel, in a life which had become so simple. For
nothing could be simpler than the life of a plongeur. He lives in a rhythm between work
and sleep, without time to think, hardly conscious of the exterior world; his Paris has
shrunk to the hotel, the Metro, a few bistros and his bed. If he goes afield, it is only a few
streets away, on a trip with some servant-girl who sits on his knee swallowing oysters
and beer. On his free day he lies in bed till noon, puts on a clean shirt, throws dice for
drinks, and after lunch goes back to bed again. Nothing is quite real to him but
the boulot, drinks and sleep; and of these sleep is the most important.
One night, in the small hours, there was a murder just beneath my window. I was woken
by a fearful uproar, and, going to the window, saw a man lying flat on the stones below; I
could see the murderers, three of them, flitting away at the end of the street. Some of us
went down and found that the man was quite dead, his skull cracked with a piece of lead
piping. I remember the colour of his blood, curiously purple, like wine; it was still on the
cobbles when I came home that evening, and they said the schoolchildren had come
from miles round to see it. But the thing that strikes me in looking back is that I was in
bed and asleep within three minutes of the murder. So were most of the people in the
street; we just made sure that the man was done for, and went straight back to bed. We
were working people, and where was the sense of wasting sleep over a murder?
Work in the hotel taught me the true value of sleep, just as being hungry had taught me
the true value of food. Sleep had ceased to be a mere physical necessity; it was
something voluptuous, a debauch more than a relief. I had no more trouble with the
bugs. Mario had told me of a sure remedy for them, namely pepper, strewed thick over
the bedclothes. It made me sneeze, but the bugs all hated it, and emigrated to other
rooms.

Chapter 17
With thirty francs a week to spend on drinks I could take part in the social life of the
quarter. We had some jolly evenings, on Saturdays, in the little bistro at the foot of the
Hôtel des Trois Moineaux.
The brick-floored room, fifteen feet square, was packed with twenty people, and the air
dim with smoke. The noise was deafening, for everyone was either talking at the top of
his voice or singing. Sometimes it was just a confused din of voices; sometimes everyone
would burst out together in the same song—the 'Marseillaise', or the 'Internationale', or
'Madelon', or 'Les Fraises et les Framboises'. Azaya, a great clumping peasant girl who
worked fourteen hours a day in a glass factory, sang a song about, 'Elle a perdu son
pantalon, tout en dansant le Charleston.' Her friend Marinette, a thin, dark Corsican girl
of obstinate virtue, tied her knees together and danced the danse du ventre. The old
Rougiers wandered in and out, cadging drinks and trying to tell a long, involved story
about someone who had once cheated them over a bedstead. R., cadaverous and silent,
sat in his corner quietly boozing. Charlie, drunk, half danced, half staggered to and fro
with a glass of sham absinthe balanced in one fat hand, pinching the women's breasts
and declaiming poetry. People played darts and diced for drinks. Manuel, a Spaniard,
dragged the girls to the bar and shook the dice-box against their bellies, for luck.
Madame F. stood at the bar rapidly pouring chopines of wine through the pewter funnel,
with a wet dishcloth always handy, because every man in the room tried to make love to
her. Two children, bastards of big Louis the bricklayer, sat in a corner sharing a glass
of sirop. Everyone was very happy, overwhelmingly certain that the world was a good
place and we a notable set of people.
For an hour the noise scarcely slackened. Then about midnight there was a piercing
shout of 'Citoyens!' and the sound of a chair falling over. A blond, red-faced workman
had risen to his feet and was banging a bottle on the table. Everyone stopped singing;
the word went round, 'Sh! Fureux is starting!' Fureux was a strange creature, a Limousin
stonemason who worked steadily all the week and drank himself into a kind of
paroxysm on Saturdays. He had lost his memory and could not remember anything
before the war, and he would have gone to pieces through drink if Madame F. had not
taken care of him. On Saturday evenings at about five o'clock she would say to someone,
'Catch Fureux before he spends his wages,' and when he had been caught she would
take away his money, leaving him enough for one good drunk. One week he escaped,
and, rolling blind drunk in the Place Monge, was run over by a car and badly hurt.
The queer thing about Fureux was that, though he was a Communist when sober, he
turned violently patriotic when drunk. He started the evening with good Communist
principles, but after four or five litres he was a rampant Chauvinist, denouncing spies,
challenging all foreigners to fight, and, if he was not prevented, throwing bottles. It was
at this stage that he made his speech—for he made a patriotic speech every Saturday
night. The speech was always the same, word for word. It ran:
'Citizens of the Republic, are there any Frenchmen here? If there are any Frenchmen
here, I rise to remind them—to remind them in effect, of the glorious days of the war.
52
When one looks back upon that time of comradeship and heroism—one looks back, in
effect, upon that time of comradeship and heroism. When one remembers the heroes
who are dead—one remembers, in effect, the heroes who are dead. Citizens of the
Republic, I was wounded at Verdun—'
Here he partially undressed and showed the wound he had received at Verdun. There
were shouts of applause. We thought nothing in the world could be funnier than this
speech of Fureux's. He was a well-known spectacle in the quarter; people used to come
in from other bistros to watch him when his fit started.
The word was passed round to bait Fureux. With a wink to the others someone called
for silence, and asked him to sing the 'Marseillaise'. He sang it well, in a fine bass voice,
with patriotic gurgling noises deep down in his chest when he came to 'Aux arrmes,
citoyens! Forrmez vos bataillons!' Veritable tears rolled down his cheeks; he was too
drunk to see that everyone was laughing at him. Then, before he had finished, two
strong workmen seized him by either arm and held him down, while Azaya shouted,
'Vive l'Allemagne!' just out of his reach. Fureux's face went purple at such infamy.
Everyone in the bistro began shouting together, 'Vive l'Allemagne! À bas la France!' while
Fureux struggled to get at them. But suddenly he spoiled the fun. His face turned pale
and doleful, his limbs went limp, and before anyone could stop him he was sick on the
table. Then Madame F. hoisted him like a sack and carried him up to bed. In the morning
he reappeared, quiet and civil, and bought a copy of L'Humanité.
The table was wiped with a cloth, Madame F. brought more litre bottles and loaves of
bread, and we settled down to serious drinking. There were more songs. An itinerant
singer came in with his banjo and performed for five-sou pieces. An Arab and a girl from
the bistro down the street did a dance, the man wielding a painted wooden phallus the
size of a rolling-pin. There were gaps in the noise now. People had begun to talk about
their love-affairs, and the war, and the barbel fishing in the Seine, and the best way
to faire la révolution, and to tell stories. Charlie, grown sober again, captured the
conversation and talked about his soul for five minutes. The doors and windows were
opened to cool the room. The street was emptying, and in the distance one could hear
the lonely milk train thundering down the Boulevard St Michel. The air blew cold on our
foreheads, and the coarse African wine still tasted good; we were still happy, but
meditatively, with the shouting and hilarious mood finished.
By one o'clock we were not happy any longer. We felt the joy of the evening wearing
thin, and called hastily for more bottles, but Madame F. was watering the wine now, and
it did not taste the same. Men grew quarrelsome. The girls were violently kissed and
hands thrust into their bosoms and they made off lest worse should happen. Big Louis,
the bricklayer, was drunk, and crawled about the floor barking and pretending to be a
dog. The others grew tired of him and kicked at him as he went past. People seized each
other by the arm and began long rambling confessions, and were angry when these
were not listened to. The crowd thinned. Manuel and another man, both gamblers, went
across to the Arab bistro, where card-playing went on till daylight. Charlie suddenly
borrowed thirty francs from Madame F. and disappeared, probably to a brothel. Men
began to empty their glasses, call briefly, ''sieurs, dames!' and go off to bed.
By half-past one the last drop of pleasure had evaporated, leaving nothing but
headaches. We perceived that we were not splendid inhabitants of a splendid world, but
a crew of underpaid workmen grown squalidly and dismally drunk. We went on
swallowing the wine, but it was only from habit, and the stuff seemed suddenly
53
nauseating. One's head had swollen up like a balloon, the floor rocked, one's tongue and
lips were stained purple. At last it was no use keeping it up any longer. Several men
went out into the yard behind the bistro and were sick. We crawled up to bed, tumbled
down half dressed, and stayed there ten hours.
Most of my Saturday nights went in this way. On the whole, the two hours when one
was perfectly and wildly happy seemed worth the subsequent headache. For many men
in the quarter, unmarried and with no future to think of, the weekly drinking-bout was
the one thing that made life worth living.
54
Chapter 18
Charlie told us a good story one Saturday night in the bistro. Try and picture him—
drunk, but sober enough to talk consecutively. He bangs on the zinc bar and yells for
silence:
'Silence, messieurs et dames—silence, I implore you! Listen to this story that I am about
to tell you. A memorable story, an instructive story, one of the souvenirs of a refined and
civilized life. Silence, messieurs et dames!
'It happened at a time when I was hard up. You know what that is like—how damnable,
that a man of refinement should ever be in such a condition. My money had not come
from home; I had pawned everything, and there was nothing open to me except to work,
which is a thing I will not do. I was living with a girl at the time—Yvonne her name
was—a great half-witted peasant girl like Azaya there, with yellow hair and fat legs. The
two of us had eaten nothing in three days. Mon Dieu, what sufferings! The girl used to
walk up and down the room with her hands on her belly, howling like a dog that she
was dying of starvation. It was terrible.
'But to a man of intelligence nothing is impossible. I propounded to myself the question,
"What is the easiest way to get money without working?" And immediately the answer
came: "To get money easily one must be a woman. Has not every woman something to
sell?" And then, as I lay reflecting upon the things I should do if I were a woman, an idea
came into my head. I remembered the Government maternity hospitals—you know the
Government maternity hospitals? They are places where women who are enceinte are
given meals free and no questions are asked. It is done to encourage childbearing. Any
woman can go there and demand a meal, and she is given it immediately.
'"Mon Dieu!" I thought, "if only I were a woman! I would eat at one of those places every
day. Who can tell whether a woman is enceinte or not, without an examination?"
'I turned to Yvonne. "Stop that insufferable bawling," I said; "I have thought of a way to
get food."
'"How?" said she.
'"It is simple," I said. "Go to the Government maternity hospital. Tell them you
are enceinte and ask for food. They will give you a good meal and ask no questions."
'Yvonne was appalled. "Mais, mon Dieu," she cried, "I am not enceinte!"
'"Who cares?" I said. "That is easily remedied. What do you need except a cushion—two
cushions if necessary? It is an inspiration from heaven, ma chère. Don't waste it."
'Well, in the end I persuaded her, and then we borrowed a cushion and I got her ready
and took her to the maternity hospital. They received her with open arms. They gave
her cabbage soup, a ragoût of beef, a purée of potatoes, bread and cheese and beer, and
all kinds of advice about her baby. Yvonne gorged till she almost burst her skin, and
managed to slip some of the bread and cheese into her pocket for me. I took her there
every day until I had money again. My intelligence had saved us.
55
'Everything went well until a year later. I was with Yvonne again, and one day we were
walking down the Boulevard Port Royal, near the barracks. Suddenly Yvonne's mouth
fell open, and she began turning red and white, and red again.
'"Mon Dieu!" she cried, "look at that who is coming! It is the nurse who was in charge at
the maternity hospital, I am ruined!"
'"Quick!" I said, "run!" But it was too late. The nurse had recognized Yvonne, and she
came straight up to us, smiling. She was a big fat woman with a gold pince-nez and red
cheeks like the cheeks of an apple. A motherly, interfering kind of woman.
'"I hope you are well, ma petite?" she said kindly. "And your baby, is he well too? Was it
a boy, as you were hoping?"
'Yvonne had begun trembling so hard that I had to grip her arm. "No," she said at last.
'"Ah, then, évidemment, it was a girl?"
'Thereupon Yvonne, the idiot, lost her head completely. "No," she actually said again!
'The nurse was taken aback. "Comment!" she exclaimed, "neither a boy nor a girl! But
how can that be?"
'Figure to yourselves, messieurs et dames, it was a dangerous moment. Yvonne had
turned the colour of a beetroot and looked ready to burst into tears; another second and
she would have confessed everything. Heaven knows what might have happened. But as
for me, I had kept my head; I stepped in and saved the situation.
'"It was twins," I said calmly.
'"Twins!" exclaimed the nurse. And she was so pleased that she took Yvonne by the
shoulders and embraced her on both cheeks, publicly.
'Yes, twins . . .'
56
Chapter 19
One day, when we had been at the Hôtel X. five or six weeks, Boris disappeared without
notice. In the evening I found him waiting for me in the Rue de Rivoli. He slapped me
gaily on the shoulder.
'Free at last, mon ami! You can give notice in the morning. The Auberge opens
tomorrow.'
'Tomorrow?'
'Well, possibly we shall need a day or two to arrange things. But, at any rate, no
more cafeterie! Nous voilà lancés, mon ami! My tail coat is out of pawn already.'
His manner was so hearty that I felt sure there was something wrong, and I did not at all
want to leave my safe and comfortable job at the hotel. However, I had promised Boris,
so I gave notice, and the next morning at seven went down to the Auberge de Jehan
Cottard. It was locked, and I went in search of Boris, who had once more bolted from his
lodgings and taken a room in the Rue de la Croix Nivert. I found him asleep, together
with a girl whom he had picked up the night before, and who he told me was 'of a very
sympathetic temperament'. As to the restaurant, he said that it was all arranged; there
were only a few little things to be seen to before we opened.
At ten I managed to get Boris out of bed, and we unlocked the restaurant. At a glance I
saw what the 'few little things' amounted to; it was briefly this: that the alterations had
not been touched since our last visit. The stoves for the kitchen had not arrived, the
water and electricity had not been laid on, and there was all manner of painting,
polishing and carpentering to be done. Nothing short of a miracle could open the
restaurant within ten days, and by the look of things it might collapse without even
opening. It was obvious what had happened. The patron was short of money, and he had
engaged the staff (there were four of us) in order to use us instead of workmen. He
would be getting our services almost free, for waiters are paid no wages, and, though he
would have to pay me, he would not be feeding me till the restaurant opened. In effect,
he had swindled us of several hundred francs by sending for us before the restaurant
was open. We had thrown up a good job for nothing.
Boris, however, was full of hope. He had only one idea in his head, namely, that here at
last was a chance of being a waiter and wearing a tail coat once more. For this he was
quite willing to do ten days' work unpaid, with the chance of being left jobless in the
end. 'Patience!' he kept saying. 'That will arrange itself. Wait till the restaurant opens,
and we'll get it all back. Patience, mon ami!'
We needed patience, for days passed and the restaurant did not even progress towards
opening. We cleaned out the cellars, fixed the shelves, distempered the walls, polished
the woodwork, whitewashed the ceiling, stained the floor; but the main work, the
plumbing and gasfitting and electricity, was still not done, because the patron could not
pay the bills. Evidently he was almost penniless, for he refused the smallest charges, and
he had a trick of swiftly disappearing when asked for money. His blend of shiftiness and
aristocratic manners made him very hard to deal with. Melancholy duns came looking
57
for him at all hours, and by instruction we always told them that he was at
Fontainebleau, or Saint Cloud, or some other place that was safely distant. Meanwhile I
was getting hungrier and hungrier. I had left the hotel with thirty francs, and I had to go
back immediately to a diet of dry bread. Boris had managed in the beginning to extract
an advance of sixty francs from the patron, but he had spent half of it in redeeming his
waiter's clothes, and half on the girl of sympathetic temperament. He borrowed three
francs a day from Jules, the second waiter, and spent it on bread. Some days we had not
even money for tobacco.
Sometimes the cook came to see how things were getting on, and when she saw that the
kitchen was still bare of pots and pans she usually wept. Jules, the second waiter,
refused steadily to help with the work. He was a Magyar, a little dark, sharp-featured
fellow in spectacles, and very talkative; he had been a medical student, but had
abandoned his training for lack of money. He had a taste for talking while other people
were working, and he told me all about himself and his ideas. It appeared that he was a
Communist, and had various strange theories (he could prove to you by figures that it
was wrong to work), and he was also, like most Magyars, passionately proud. Proud and
lazy men do not make good waiters. It was Jules's dearest boast that once when a
customer in a restaurant had insulted him, he had poured a plate of hot soup down the
customer's neck, and then walked straight out without even waiting to be sacked.
As each day went by Jules grew more and more enraged at the trick the patron had
played on us. He had a spluttering, oratorical way of talking. He used to walk up and
down shaking his fist, and trying to incite me not to work:
'Put that brush down, you fool! You and I belong to proud races; we don't work for
nothing, like these damned Russian serfs. I tell you, to be cheated like this is torture to
me. There have been times in my life, when someone has cheated me even of five sous,
when I have vomited—yes, vomited with rage.
'Besides, mon vieux, don't forget that I'm a Communist. À bas les bourgeois! Did any man
alive ever see me working when I could avoid it? No. And not only I don't wear myself
out working, like you other fools, but I steal, just to show my independence. Once I was
in a restaurant where the patron thought he could treat me like a dog. Well, in revenge I
found out a way to steal milk from the milk-cans and seal them up again so that no one
should know. I tell you, I just swilled that milk down night and morning. Every day I
drank four litres of milk, besides half a litre of cream. The patron was at his wits' end to
know where the milk was going. It wasn't that I wanted milk, you understand, because I
hate the stuff; it was principle, just principle.
'Well, after three days I began to get dreadful pains in my belly, and I went to the doctor.
"What have you been eating?" he said. I said: "I drink four litres of milk a day, and half a
litre of cream." "Four litres!" he said. "Then stop it at once. You'll burst if you go on."
"What do I care?" I said. "With me principle is everything. I shall go on drinking that
milk, even if I do burst."
'Well, the next day the patron caught me stealing milk. "You're sacked," he said; "you
leave at the end of the week." "Pardon, monsieur," I said, "I shall leave this morning."
"No, you won't," he said, "I can't spare you till Saturday." "Very well, mon patron," I
thought to myself, "we'll see who gets tired of it first." And then I set to work to smash
the crockery. I broke nine plates the first day and thirteen the second; after that
the patron was glad to see the last of me.
58
'Ah, I'm not one of your Russian moujiks . . .'
Ten days passed. It was a bad time. I was absolutely at the end of my money, and my
rent was several days overdue. We loafed about the dismal empty restaurant, too
hungry even to get on with the work that remained. Only Boris now believed that the
restaurant would open. He had set his heart on being maître d'hôtel, and he invented a
theory that the patron's money was tied up in shares and he was waiting a favourable
moment for selling. On the tenth day I had nothing to eat or smoke, and I told
the patron that I could not continue working without an advance on my wages. As
blandly as usual, the patron promised the advance, and then, according to his custom,
vanished. I walked part of the way home, but I did not feel equal to a scene with
Madame F. over the rent, so I passed the night on a bench on the boulevard. It was very
uncomfortable—the arm of the seat cuts into your back—and much colder than I had
expected. There was plenty of time, in the long boring hours between dawn and work, to
think what a fool I had been to deliver myself into the hands of these Russians.
Then, in the morning, the luck changed. Evidently the patron had come to an
understanding with his creditors, for he arrived with money in his pockets, set the
alterations going, and gave me my advance. Boris and I bought macaroni and a piece of
horse's liver, and had our first hot meal in ten days.
The workmen were brought in and the alterations made, hastily and with incredible
shoddiness. The tables, for instance, were to be covered with baize, but when
the patron found that baize was expensive he bought instead disused army blankets,
smelling incorrigibly of sweat. The table-cloths (they were check, to go with the
'Norman' decorations) would cover them, of course. On the last night we were at work
till two in the morning, getting things ready. The crockery did not arrive till eight, and,
being new, had all to be washed. The cutlery did not arrive till the next morning, nor the
linen either, so that we had to dry the crockery with a shirt of the patron's and an old
pillowslip belonging to the concierge. Boris and I did all the work. Jules was skulking,
and the patron and his wife sat in the bar with a dun and some Russian friends, drinking
success to the restaurant. The cook was in the kitchen with her head on the table,
crying, because she was expected to cook for fifty people, and there were not pots and
pans enough for ten. About midnight there was a fearful interview with some duns, who
came intending to seize eight copper saucepans which the patron had obtained on
credit. They were bought off with half a bottle of brandy.
Jules and I missed the last Metro home and had to sleep on the floor of the restaurant.
The first thing we saw in the morning were two large rats sitting on the kitchen table,
eating from a ham that stood there. It seemed a bad omen, and I was surer than ever
that the Auberge de Jehan Cottard would turn out a failure.
59
Chapter 20
The patron had engaged me as kitchen plongeur; that is, my job was to wash up, keep
the kitchen clean, prepare vegetables, make tea, coffee and sandwiches, do the simpler
cooking, and run errands. The terms were, as usual, five hundred francs a month and
food, but I had no free day and no fixed working hours. At the Hôtel X. I had seen
catering at its best, with unlimited money and good organization. Now, at the Auberge, I
learned how things are done in a thoroughly bad restaurant. It is worth describing, for
there are hundreds of similar restaurants in Paris, and every visitor feeds in one of them
occasionally.
I should add, by the way, that the Auberge was not the ordinary cheap eating-house
frequented by students and workmen. We did not provide an adequate meal at less than
twenty-five francs, and we were picturesque and artistic, which sent up our social
standing. There were the indecent pictures in the bar, and the Norman decorations—
sham beams on the walls, electric lights done up as candlesticks, 'peasant' pottery, even
a mounting-block at the door—and the patron and the head waiter were Russian
officers, and many of the customers titled Russian refugees. In short, we were decidedly
chic.
Nevertheless, the conditions behind the kitchen door were suitable for a pigsty. For this
is what our service arrangements were like:
The kitchen measured fifteen feet long by eight broad, and half this space was taken up
by the stoves and tables. All the pots had to be kept on shelves out of reach, and there
was only room for one dustbin. This dustbin used to be crammed full by midday, and the
floor was normally an inch deep in a compost of trampled food.
For firing we had nothing but three gas-stoves, without ovens, and all joints had to be
sent out to the bakery.
There was no larder. Our substitute for one was a half-roofed shed in the yard, with a
tree growing in the middle of it. The meat, vegetables and so forth lay there on the bare
earth, raided by rats and cats.
There was no hot water laid on. Water for washing up had to be heated in pans, and, as
there was no room for these on the stoves when meals were cooking, most of the plates
had to be washed in cold water. This, with soft soap and the hard Paris water, meant
scraping the grease off with bits of newspaper.
We were so short of saucepans that I had to wash each one as soon as it was done with,
instead of leaving them till the evening. This alone wasted probably an hour a day.
Owing to some scamping of expense in the installation, the electric light usually fused at
eight in the evening. The patron would only allow us three candles in the kitchen, and
the cook said three were unlucky, so we had only two.
Our coffee-grinder was borrowed from a bistro near by, and our dustbin and brooms
from the concierge. After the first week a quantity of linen did not come back from the
wash, as the bill was not paid. We were in trouble with the inspector of labour, who had
60
discovered that the staff included no Frenchmen; he had several private interviews with
the patron, who, I believe, was obliged to bribe him. The electric company was still
dunning us, and when the duns found that we would buy them off with apéritifs, they
came every morning. We were in debt at the grocery, and credit would have been
stopped, only the grocer's wife (a moustachio'd woman of sixty) had taken a fancy to
Jules, who was sent every morning to cajole her. Similarly I had to waste an hour every
day haggling over vegetables in the Rue du Commerce, to save a few centimes.
These are the results of starting a restaurant on insufficient capital. And in these
conditions the cook and I were expected to serve thirty or forty meals a day, and would
later on be serving a hundred. From the first day it was too much for us. The cook's
working hours were from eight in the morning till midnight, and mine from seven in the
morning till half-past twelve the next morning—seventeen and a half hours, almost
without a break. We never had time to sit down till five in the afternoon, and even then
there was no seat except the top of the dustbin. Boris, who lived near by and had not to
catch the last Metro home, worked from eight in the morning till two the next
morning—eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. Such hours, though not usual, are
nothing extraordinary in Paris.
Life settled at once into a routine that made the Hôtel X. seem like a holiday. Every
morning at six I drove myself out of bed, did not shave, sometimes washed, hurried up
to the Place d'Italie and fought for a place on the Metro. By seven I was in the desolation
of the cold, filthy kitchen, with the potato skins and bones and fishtails littered on the
floor, and a pile of plates, stuck together in their grease, waiting from overnight. I could
not start on the plates yet, because the water was cold, and I had to fetch milk and make
coffee, for the others arrived at eight and expected to find coffee ready. Also, there were
always several copper saucepans to clean. Those copper saucepans are the bane of
a plongeur's life. They have to be scoured with sand and bunches of chain, ten minutes
to each one, and then polished on the outside with Brasso. Fortunately the art of making
them has been lost and they are gradually vanishing from French kitchens, though one
can still buy them second-hand.
When I had begun on the plates the cook would take me away from the plates to begin
skinning onions, and when I had begun on the onions the patron would arrive and send
me out to buy cabbages. When I came back with the cabbages the patron's wife would
tell me to go to some shop half a mile away and buy a pot of rouge; by the time I came
back there would be more vegetables waiting, and the plates were still not done. In this
way our incompetence piled one job on another throughout the day, everything in
arrears.
Till ten, things went comparatively easily, though we were working fast, and no one lost
his temper. The cook would find time to talk about her artistic nature, and say did I not
think Tolstoi was épatant, and sing in a fine soprano voice as she minced beef on the
board. But at ten the waiters began clamouring for their lunch, which they had early,
and at eleven the first customers would be arriving. Suddenly everything became hurry
and bad temper. There was not the same furious rushing and yelling as at the Hôtel X.,
but an atmosphere of muddle, petty spite and exasperation. Discomfort was at the
bottom of it. It was unbearably cramped in the kitchen, and dishes had to be put on the
floor, and one had to be thinking constantly about not stepping on them. The cook's vast
buttocks banged against me as she moved to and fro. A ceaseless, nagging chorus of
orders streamed from her:
61
'Unspeakable idiot! How many times have I told you not to bleed the beetroots? Quick,
let me get to the sink! Put those knives away; get on with the potatoes. What have you
done with my strainer? Oh, leave those potatoes alone. Didn't I tell you to skim
the bouillon? Take that can of water off the stove. Never mind the washing up, chop this
celery. No, not like that, you fool, like this. There! Look at you letting those peas boil
over! Now get to work and scale these herrings. Look, do you call this plate clean? Wipe
it on your apron. Put that salad on the floor. That's right, put it where I'm bound to step
in it! Look out, that pot's boiling over! Get me down that saucepan. No, the other one.
Put this on the grill. Throw those potatoes away. Don't waste time, throw them on the
floor. Tread them in. Now throw down some sawdust; this floor's like a skating-rink.
Look, you fool, that steak's burning! Mon Dieu, why did they send me an idiot for
a plongeur? Who are you talking to? Do you realize that my aunt was a Russian
countess?' etc. etc. etc.
This went on till three o'clock without much variation, except that about eleven the cook
usually had a crise de nerfs and a flood of tears. From three to five was a fairly slack time
for the waiters, but the cook was still busy, and I was working my fastest, for there was
a pile of dirty plates waiting, and it was a race to get them done, or partly done, before
dinner began. The washing up was doubled by the primitive conditions—a cramped
draining-board, tepid water, sodden cloths, and a sink that got blocked once in an hour.
By five the cook and I were feeling unsteady on our feet, not having eaten or sat down
since seven. We used to collapse, she on the dustbin and I on the floor, drink a bottle of
beer, and apologize for some of the things we had said in the morning. Tea was what
kept us going. We took care to have a pot always stewing, and drank pints during the
day.
At half-past five the hurry and quarrelling began again, and now worse than before,
because everyone was tired out. The cook had a crise de nerfs at six and another at nine;
they came on so regularly that one could have told the time by them. She would flop
down on the dustbin, begin weeping hysterically, and cry out that never, no, never had
she thought to come to such a life as this; her nerves would not stand it; she had studied
music at Vienna; she had a bedridden husband to support, etc. etc. At another time one
would have been sorry for her, but, tired as we all were, her whimpering voice merely
infuriated us. Jules used to stand in the doorway and mimic her weeping. The patron's
wife nagged, and Boris and Jules quarrelled all day, because Jules shirked his work, and
Boris, as head waiter, claimed the larger share of the tips. Only the second day after the
restaurant opened, they came to blows in the kitchen over a two-franc tip, and the cook
and I had to separate them. The only person who never forgot his manners was
the patron. He kept the same hours as the rest of us, but he had no work to do, for it was
his wife who really managed things. His sole job, besides ordering the supplies, was to
stand in the bar smoking cigarettes and looking gentlemanly, and he did that to
perfection.
The cook and I generally found time to eat our dinner between ten and eleven o'clock.
At midnight the cook would steal a packet of food for her husband, stow it under her
clothes, and make off, whimpering that these hours would kill her and she would give
notice in the morning. Jules also left at midnight, usually after a dispute with Boris, who
had to look after the bar till two. Between twelve and half-past I did what I could to
finish the washing up. There was no time to attempt doing the work properly, and I
used simply to rub the grease off the plates with table-napkins. As for the dirt on the
floor, I let it lie, or swept the worst of it out of sight under the stoves.
62
At half-past twelve I would put on my coat and hurry out. The patron, bland as ever,
would stop me as I went down the alley-way past the bar. 'Mais, mon cher monsieur, how
tired you look! Please do me the favour of accepting this glass of brandy.'
He would hand me the glass of brandy as courteously as though I had been a Russian
duke instead of a plongeur. He treated all of us like this. It was our compensation for
working seventeen hours a day.
As a rule the last Metro was almost empty—a great advantage, for one could sit down
and sleep for a quarter of an hour. Generally I was in bed by half-past one. Sometimes I
missed the train and had to sleep on the floor of the restaurant, but it hardly mattered,
for I could have slept on cobblestones at that time.
63
Chapter 21
This life went on for about a fortnight, with a slight increase of work as more customers
came to the restaurant. I could have saved an hour a day by taking a room near the
restaurant, but it seemed impossible to find time to change lodgings—or, for that
matter, to get my hair cut, look at a newspaper, or even undress completely. After ten
days I managed to find a free quarter of an hour, and wrote to my friend B. in London
asking him if he could get me a job of some sort—anything, so long as it allowed more
than five hours' sleep. I was simply not equal to going on with a seventeen-hour day,
though there are plenty of people who think nothing of it. When one is overworked, it is
a good cure for self-pity to think of the thousands of people in Paris restaurants who
work such hours, and will go on doing it, not for a few weeks, but for years. There was a
girl in a bistro near my hotel who worked from seven in the morning till midnight for a
whole year, only sitting down to her meals. I remember once asking her to come to a
dance, and she laughed and said that she had not been further than the street corner for
several months. She was consumptive, and died about the time I left Paris.
After only a week we were all neurasthenic with fatigue, except Jules, who skulked
persistently. The quarrels, intermittent at first, had now become continuous. For hours
one would keep up a drizzle of useless nagging, rising into storms of abuse every few
minutes. 'Get me down that saucepan, idiot!' the cook would cry (she was not tall
enough to reach the shelves where the saucepans were kept). 'Get it down yourself, you
old whore,' I would answer. Such remarks seemed to be generated spontaneously from
the air of the kitchen.
We quarrelled over things of inconceivable pettiness. The dustbin, for instance, was an
unending source of quarrels—whether it should be put where I wanted it, which was in
the cook's way, or where she wanted it, which was between me and the sink. Once she
nagged and nagged until at last, in pure spite, I lifted the dustbin up and put it out in the
middle of the floor, where she was bound to trip over it.
'Now, you cow,' I said, 'move it yourself.'
Poor old woman, it was too heavy for her to lift, and she sat down, put her head on the
table and burst out crying. And I jeered at her. This is the kind of effect that fatigue has
upon one's manners.
After a few days the cook had ceased talking about Tolstoi and her artistic nature, and
she and I were not on speaking terms, except for the purposes of work, and Boris and
Jules were not on speaking terms, and neither of them was on speaking terms with the
cook. Even Boris and I were barely on speaking terms. We had agreed beforehand that
the engueulades of working hours did not count between times; but we had called each
other things too bad to be forgotten—and besides, there were no between times. Jules
grew lazier and lazier, and he stole food constantly—from a sense of duty, he said. He
called the rest of us jaune—blackleg—when we would not join with him in stealing. He
had a curious, malignant spirit. He told me, as a matter of pride, that he had sometimes
wrung a dirty dishcloth into a customer's soup before taking it in, just to be revenged
upon a member of the bourgeoisie.
64
The kitchen grew dirtier and the rats bolder, though we trapped a few of them. Looking
round that filthy room, with raw meat lying among the refuse on the floor, and cold,
clotted saucepans sprawling everywhere, and the sink blocked and coated with grease, I
used to wonder whether there could be a restaurant in the world as bad as ours. But the
other three all said that they had been in dirtier places. Jules took a positive pleasure in
seeing things dirty. In the afternoon, when he had not much to do, he used to stand in
the kitchen doorway jeering at us for working too hard:
'Fool! Why do you wash that plate? Wipe it on your trousers. Who cares about the
customers? They don't know what's going on. What is restaurant work? You are carving
a chicken and it falls on the floor. You apologize, you bow, you go out; and in five
minutes you come back by another door—with the same chicken. That is restaurant
work,' etc.
And, strange to say, in spite of all this filth and incompetence, the Auberge de Jehan
Cottard was actually a success. For the first few days all our customers were Russians,
friends of the patron, and these were followed by Americans and other foreigners—no
Frenchmen. Then one night there was tremendous excitement, because our first
Frenchman had arrived. For a moment our quarrels were forgotten and we all united in
the effort to serve a good dinner. Boris tiptoed into the kitchen, jerked his thumb over
his shoulder and whispered conspiratorially:
'Sh! Attention, un Français!'
A moment later the patron's wife came and whispered:
'Attention, un Français! See that he gets a double portion of all vegetables.'
While the Frenchman ate, the patron's wife stood behind the grille of the kitchen door
and watched the expression of his face. Next night the Frenchman came back with two
other Frenchmen. This meant that we were earning a good name; the surest sign of a
bad restaurant is to be frequented only by foreigners. Probably part of the reason for
our success was that the patron, with the sole gleam of sense he had shown in fitting out
the restaurant, had bought very sharp table-knives. Sharp knives, of course,
are the secret of a successful restaurant. I am glad that this happened, for it destroyed
one of my illusions, namely, the idea that Frenchmen know good food when they see it.
Or perhaps we were a fairly good restaurant by Paris standards; in which case the bad
ones must be past imagining.
In a very few days after I had written to B. he replied to say that there was a job he could
get for me. It was to look after a congenital imbecile, which sounded a splendid rest cure
after the Auberge de Jehan Cottard. I pictured myself loafing in the country lanes,
knocking thistle-heads off with my stick, feeding on roast lamb and treacle tart, and
sleeping ten hours a night in sheets smelling of lavender. B. sent me a fiver to pay my
passage and get my clothes out of pawn, and as soon as the money arrived I gave one
day's notice and left the restaurant. My leaving so suddenly embarrassed the patron, for
as usual he was penniless, and he had to pay my wages thirty francs short. However, he
stood me a glass of Courvoisier '48 brandy, and I think he felt that this made up the
difference. They engaged a Czech, a thoroughly competent plongeur, in my place, and
the poor old cook was sacked a few weeks later. Afterwards I heard that, with two firstrate people in the kitchen, the plongeur's work had been cut down to fifteen hours a day.
Below that no one could have cut it, short of modernizing the kitchen.

Chapter 22
For what they are worth I want to give my opinions about the life of a Paris plongeur.
When one comes to think of it, it is strange that thousands of people in a great modern
city should spend their waking hours swabbing dishes in hot dens underground. The
question I am raising is why this life goes on—what purpose it serves, and who wants it
to continue, and why. I am not taking the merely rebellious, fainéant attitude. I am
trying to consider the social significance of a plongeur's life.
I think one should start by saying that a plongeur is one of the slaves of the modern
world. Not that there is any need to whine over him, for he is better off than many
manual workers, but still, he is no freer than if he were bought and sold. His work is
servile and without art; he is paid just enough to keep him alive; his only holiday is the
sack. He is cut off from marriage, or, if he marries, his wife must work too. Except by a
lucky chance, he has no escape from this life, save into prison. At this moment there are
men with university degrees scrubbing dishes in Paris for ten or fifteen hours a day. One
cannot say that it is mere idleness on their part, for an idle man cannot be a plongeur;
they have simply been trapped by a routine which makes thought impossible.
If plongeurs thought at all, they would long ago have formed a union and gone on strike
for better treatment. But they do not think, because they have no leisure for it; their life
has made slaves of them.
The question is, why does this slavery continue? People have a way of taking it for
granted that all work is done for a sound purpose. They see somebody else doing a
disagreeable job, and think that they have solved things by saying that the job is
necessary. Coal-mining, for example, is hard work, but it is necessary—we must have
coal. Working in the sewers is unpleasant, but somebody must work in the sewers. And
similarly with a plongeur's work. Some people must feed in restaurants, and so other
people must swab dishes for eighty hours a week. It is the work of civilization, therefore
unquestionable. This point is worth considering.
Is a plongeur's work really necessary to civilization? We have a vague feeling that it
must be 'honest' work, because it is hard and disagreeable, and we have made a sort of
fetish of manual work. We see a man cutting down a tree, and we make sure that he is
filling a social need, just because he uses his muscles; it does not occur to us that he may
only be cutting down a beautiful tree to make room for a hideous statue. I believe it is
the same with a plongeur. He earns his bread in the sweat of his brow, but it does not
follow that he is doing anything useful; he may be only supplying a luxury which, very
often, is not a luxury.
As an example of what I mean by luxuries which are not luxuries, take an extreme case,
such as one hardly sees in Europe. Take an Indian rickshaw puller, or a gharry pony. In
any Far Eastern town there are rickshaw pullers by the hundred, black wretches
weighing eight stone, clad in loincloths. Some of them are diseased; some of them are
fifty years old. For miles on end they trot in the sun or rain, head down, dragging at the
shafts, with the sweat dripping from their grey moustaches. When they go too slowly
66
the passenger calls them bahinchut.1 They earn thirty or forty rupees a month, and
cough their lungs out after a few years. The gharry ponies are gaunt, vicious things that
have been sold cheap as having a few years' work left in them. Their master looks on the
whip as a substitute for food. Their work expresses itself in a sort of equation—whip
plus food equals energy; generally it is about sixty per cent whip and forty per cent food.
Sometimes their necks are encircled by one vast sore, so that they drag all day on raw
flesh. It is still possible to make them work, however; it is just a question of thrashing
them so hard that the pain behind outweighs the pain in front. After a few years even
the whip loses its virtue, and the pony goes to the knacker. These are instances of
unnecessary work, for there is no real need for gharries and rickshaws; they only exist
because Orientals consider it vulgar to walk. They are luxuries, and, as anyone who has
ridden in them knows, very poor luxuries. They afford a small amount of convenience,
which cannot possibly balance the suffering of the men and animals.
Similarly with the plongeur. He is a king compared with a rickshaw puller or a gharry
pony, but his case is analogous. He is the slave of a hotel or a restaurant, and his slavery
is more or less useless. For, after all, where is the real need of big hotels and smart
restaurants? They are supposed to provide luxury, but in reality they provide only a
cheap, shoddy imitation of it. Nearly everyone hates hotels. Some restaurants are better
than others, but it is impossible to get as good a meal in a restaurant as one can get, for
the same expense, in a private house. No doubt hotels and restaurants must exist, but
there is no need that they should enslave hundreds of people. What makes the work in
them is not the essentials; it is the shams that are supposed to represent luxury.
Smartness, as it is called, means, in effect, merely that the staff work more and the
customers pay more; no one benefits except the proprietor, who will presently buy
himself a striped villa at Deauville. Essentially, a 'smart' hotel is a place where a
hundred people toil like devils in order that two hundred may pay through the nose for
things they do not really want. If the nonsense were cut out of hotels and restaurants,
and the work done with simple efficiency, plongeurs might work six or eight hours a day
instead of ten or fifteen.
Suppose it is granted that a plongeur's work is more or less useless. Then the question
follows, why does anyone want him to go on working? I am trying to go beyond the
immediate economic cause, and to consider what pleasure it can give anyone to think of
men swabbing dishes for life. For there is no doubt that people—comfortably situated
people—do find a pleasure in such thoughts. A slave, Marcus Cato said, should be
working when he is not sleeping. It does not matter whether his work is needed or not,
he must work, because work in itself is good—for slaves, at least. This sentiment still
survives, and it has piled up mountains of useless drudgery.
I believe that this instinct to perpetuate useless work is, at bottom, simply fear of the
mob. The mob (the thought runs) are such low animals that they would be dangerous if
they had leisure; it is safer to keep them too busy to think. A rich man who happens to
be intellectually honest, if he is questioned about the improvement of working
conditions, usually says something like this:
1 The French translation has this note (in French): A word for which there is no precise equivalent in
French. In Hindustani, bahin means 'sister' and chut 'the sexual organ'. To call someone bahinchut is to
remind him gratuitously that you are on the most intimate terms with his sister. Barnshoot is the same
word corrupted by the English soldiers who brought it back to England; it has completely lost its original
meaning.
67
'We know that poverty is unpleasant; in fact, since it is so remote, we rather enjoy
harrowing ourselves with the thought of its unpleasantness. But don't expect us to do
anything about it. We are sorry for you lower classes, just as we are sorry for a cat with
the mange, but we will fight like devils against any improvement of your condition. We
feel that you are much safer as you are. The present state of affairs suits us, and we are
not going to take the risk of setting you free, even by an extra hour a day. So, dear
brothers, since evidently you must sweat to pay for our trips to Italy, sweat and be
damned to you.'
This is particularly the attitude of intelligent, cultivated people; one can read the
substance of it in a hundred essays. Very few cultivated people have less than (say) four
hundred pounds a year, and naturally they side with the rich, because they imagine that
any liberty conceded to the poor is a threat to their own liberty. Foreseeing some dismal
Marxian Utopia as the alternative, the educated man prefers to keep things as they are.
Possibly he does not like his fellow rich very much, but he supposes that even the
vulgarest of them are less inimical to his pleasures, more his kind of people, than the
poor, and that he had better stand by them. It is this fear of a supposedly dangerous
mob that makes nearly all intelligent people conservative in their opinions.
Fear of the mob is a superstitious fear. It is based on the idea that there is some
mysterious, fundamental difference between rich and poor, as though they were two
different races, like negroes and white men. But in reality there is no such difference.
The mass of the rich and the poor are differentiated by their incomes and nothing else,
and the average millionaire is only the average dishwasher dressed in a new suit.
Change places, and handy dandy, which is the justice, which is the thief? Everyone who
has mixed on equal terms with the poor knows this quite well. But the trouble is that
intelligent, cultivated people, the very people who might be expected to have liberal
opinions, never do mix with the poor. For what do the majority of educated people
know about poverty? In my copy of Villon's poems the editor has actually thought it
necessary to explain the line 'Ne pain ne voyent qu'aux fenestres' by a footnote; so
remote is even hunger from the educated man's experience. From this ignorance a
superstitious fear of the mob results quite naturally. The educated man pictures a horde
of submen, wanting only a day's liberty to loot his house, burn his books, and set him to
work minding a machine or sweeping out a lavatory. 'Anything,' he thinks, 'any injustice,
sooner than let that mob loose.' He does not see that since there is no difference
between the mass of rich and poor, there is no question of setting the mob loose. The
mob is in fact loose now, and—in the shape of rich men—is using its power to set up
enormous treadmills of boredom, such as 'smart' hotels.
To sum up. A plongeur is a slave, and a wasted slave, doing stupid and largely
unnecessary work. He is kept at work, ultimately, because of a vague feeling that he
would be dangerous if he had leisure. And educated people, who should be on his side,
acquiesce in the process, because they know nothing about him and consequently are
afraid of him. I say this of the plongeur because it is his case I have been considering; it
would apply equally to numberless other types of worker. These are only my own ideas
about the basic facts of a plongeur's life, made without reference to immediate economic
questions, and no doubt largely platitudes. I present them as a sample of the thoughts
that are put into one's head by working in a hotel."""
